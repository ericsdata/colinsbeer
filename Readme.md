Beer Rating data


## DAta

We have a data file with 2.9 million beer reviews from Beer Advocate (?). Data is stored in text delimited files. 


## Direction
With this data we aim to

- Employ language models to: 
    - Classify beers described as "good"
        - Write a review - did this person like the beer?
    - generate descriptions of different beers, by preference
        People who liked the beer said this: ....
        People who didnt like the beer said this: ....


- Cluster word embeddings?
    - which beers / beer types are similarly described


<<<<<<< HEAD
- DATA PROFILES
    - Look at reviews with higher count of pronounds vs reviews with lower
        - i.e. Reviews that are "subjective" vs "objective"

    - Breweries
        - How many of each style a brewery makes

=======


### TO DO

- How clean is our data?
    - Newline delimited
    - Missing reviews , scores, brewery identifiers
    - Text 
        - Many reviews start with serving styles
        - Extra spacing


- NoSql? / Database repair

- General code cleanliness and workflow
