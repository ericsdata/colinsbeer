"UPDATED: MAR 6, 2004 Amber, with a wonderful offwhite head. Has a sweet aroma from toffee and chocolate. Flavor is sweet, some toffee there as well. Has a mild finish, a nice surprise.",0.0
"I did not really like this beer.  Grainy, bitter, not very fun to drink.  Also a little skunky, and Ive had this more than once so I dont think it was old.",0.0
"I was quite pleased with this beer. I tried a couple a few years back when I was a young lad who didn't appreciate the 'finer things in life' and thought it was pretty bitter, but i'm glad I bought a 6 pack, especially for the cheap price. Your usual European lager really. Poured out nice golden, with a decent head. Decent malty flavour with a bitter hint, but no unbareable. Of course, it's not spectacular, but it was well worth it.",0.0
"Tried UK 3% version in 440ml can.  Light in colour kind of like piss.  Smells like toilet water, in fact, its worse than that.  Has a nasty weak chemical taste.  A very poor beer the worst I've had for quite some time.  Drain Pour, couldn't drink it all",0.0
"Clean on the palate with a musty biscuity maltiness, but it still just tastes cheap and overcarbonated.  I would probably not pick this up again.",0.0

"Short stubby bottle from Morrissons clearance shelf. 4.8% ABV. Grainy aroma. Sweet, soft grainy pale lager with low carbonation. Some fruity character thats unwelcome. Cheap and nasty.",0.0
"Straw color with a tall waxy looking white head. One simple ring of lace. Light pale malt, wort and hint of vinegar in the aroma. Light and mildly effervescent. Watery wort flavor with a light spicy/grassy/hoppy finish. This could be quite satisfying on a really warm day.",0.0
"Notes of caramel sticky buns on the nose but very faint. Also grainy and slightly hoppy. Flavor followed. Not too bad. The pour is the best part - nice, clear, brown color with light brown, fluffy head.",0.0
"A passable lager... meaning, Ill probably pass on it next time.  This pale yellow beer claims to be brewed with water, grains, hops, and yeast, but I suspect theyre counting corn as a grain.  Slightly skunky, sweet malt aroma bereft of hops.  Bready malts in the flavor, corn syrup, and a very modest bitterness. Finishes slightly sweet with a light tinny taste.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp? Plainfield, IL<font size=-1>",0.0
"***review from June 21, 2008***	Another crap beer from the wonderful Beers Around the World mishap. Poured out a crystal clear medium hued solid gold brew, a small white cap, thin ropy lacing and retention just above a skim. The aromas was very dry and quite interesting somehow. Sort of sweet, a large grain content, plastic? and an odd underlying smell. The taste is less than appealing as it is very harsh and very watery with bad hops and a bit of metal. Comes across empty with a weak flavor similar to a light beer. Gassy and foamy too. Slight malt can be found in the aftertaste, which is unsavory. Why bother even finishing this?",0.0
"Tap @ OTH.	Pours dark brown with thick beige head.	Aroma had plenty of roasted malts with some light notes of sweet dark fruits.	Taste is the same, leaning on the light watery mouthfeel. Malty with same fruit sweetness.	Drinkable and tasy for what it is.",0.0

"Black cherry, currant- fruityish, candy sugar taste.Seems more Belgian than German, except for the palate- it is thin and crisp, easily downable. On Tap at Yard House, coral Gables. $6.",1.0
The bottle poured a clear dark garnet colored beverage with a medium sized frothy off-white head that was mostly diminishing and left good lacing on the glass. The aroma had a predominantly malt presence with notes of dark bread and toasted grains. The body was medium with lively carbonation and a somewhat watery texture. The finish was average in length and was lightly astringent. The initial flavor was lightly sweet and as it matured it became lightly bitter in the finish.,0.0
"I bought this from the LCBO because it was 6 pints for 10 bux. I was VERY surprised at just how good this beer is. Even though it is not on sale anymore, this is my new regular beer of choice.",1.0

"(Bottle) Yellow colour, slightly hazy, with frothy white head. Fruity, wheaty nose with notes of citrus, honey and white bread. Fruity, wheaty taste with citrus (lemon, mandarin), white bread, floral hints of jasmin and white bread. Thin body, with just a touch of sweetness. Quite refreshing and better than expected.",0.0
"Nothing special going on here. Poured dark brown with red edges. Ok initial head that disappeared before long, leaving only mediocre lacing. Aroma was very light coffee. Flavor was watered down coffee with a slightly grassy finish. Decent but not memorable.",0.0
"Rather clear brownish black color with medium tan head.  This has a very roasted nutty aroma to it with some hoppiness included.  Malty taste with notes of caramelization, coffee, and a carbonated bubbly finish.    I liked this Dukel though it was deceptively labeled as a Schwartzbier.  Next thing you know Ill find a pale lager in a bottle labeled Imperial Stout, because its ""Sexier"".",0.0

"Schwarzbier label at ASS in Chapel Hill. Light brown with small white head.  I smell a drain pour. Taste it too. Maybe this is a bad bottle, but this beer is not very good.  Tastes like an alcoholic drink with no discernable flavor. Blah.",0.0
A skunky lemon aroma. Pale yellow color with a moderate head. Flavor is crisp but nothing much to it. This is basically a Heineken clone but for half the cost.,0.0
"Bottled at RBESG-06, GTN. Dark brown with a beige head. A bit roasted nose, with caramel, sugar and fruity notes. The flavor is much the same, and finishes off with some bitterness and sweetness. Quite thin. (060826)",0.0
Typical pale lager. Not too bad but nothing special. On the sweet side. No hop or malt character.,0.0
"Nice darker gold color.  Not a lot of head.  It had a slight malt note, but NO noticable hops.  I'd drink it if it was around.  Nothing great.",0.0
"The liquid is a dark amber and nearly clear.  There is some fine lace left on the glass after each sip.		Interestingly, I think this smells similarly to an American Amber--more malty (with light crystal malt) than bitter.  It doesnt seem like a dunkel to me.  The flavor does revert to style with stronger darker malts coming through on the tongue.  It also has the warming characteristics of a much higher alcohol beer.  The body is light as expected.  The aftertaste is bland but well-balanced.",0.0
"Bottle. Pours gold with soapy white head. The aroma is quite sweet and grainy with a distant light caramel note. The flavor is malty and on the sweet side. Not much going on here. Some hay in the aftertaste. Drinkable, but just barely.",0.0

"Crystal clear, mahogony lager with a large frothy, off-white head. Good lacing	Both the flavor and aroma seem to be lightstruck. Skunky. Better flavors and aromas to note: chocolate, maple syrup and yeast. Well-hopped.	Light-bodied with a watery mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. Short, bitter finish.	Just can't get past that skunkiness!",0.0
"Eh. Very so, so. Smells slightly skunky, but does not taste as malty as that led me to believe. Tastes like fizzy spring water with a bit of honey mixed in. Maybe a hint of flowers. Or maybe thats just me being hopeful! Refreshing, I suppose, and therefore a decent lawnmower beer. But this will be my last one.",0.0

"11.2oz green bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester.  Pours a dark copper brown with ruby-red highlights and a thin light tan head.  Smells strongly of caramel with coffee and chocolate playing strong supporting roles.  Tastes very roasty with chocolate and coffee at the fore.  Caramel and hints of continental hops are also present.  Flavors are a bit more subtle than expected but mesh rather well.  On the lighter side of medium-bodied with moderate carbonation.  Not the most robust Schwarzbier Ive tried, but theres nothing wrong with this one.  Its tasty and very drinkable.  A solid Schwarzbier.",1.0

"Canned, alc. 4.2% (BB 02/2006)	Golden lager color, good white head, some lace. Metallic and rubbery aroma, hints of hops. Malty, light and a bit fruity palate. Gives oily and slightly harsh aftertaste. Corn or maize is maybe added.",0.0

"Bottled 330ml 	Hazy, murky yellow color, white head. Coriander-banana wheaty, quite natural witbier aroma. Light to medium bodied. Quite sweet, lots of banana, some spices. Lacks many bad off-flavors of NA beers. But lacks also alcholic kick and backbone. Empty version of quite useless beer style, but not bad as a NA beer.",0.0
"Shaker pint draft at the Flying Saucer in Kansas City, Missouri.  Pour is amber brown with not too much of an off white head.  This is a thin looking beer.  Not much aroma, roasted malt, smoke elements and some sweaty socks. Taste is the roasted smoked malt and caramel sweetness.  The palate is thin, watery and drinkable.",0.0
12oz bottle shared by Dogbrick. Clear yellow pour with a medium white head. Skunky aroma with some malt and a bit of hop. Watery and somewhat malty flavor with a bit of hop at the end. About what I expected out of my first ever taste of a NA beer.,0.0
"Looks pretty average, pale gold, head is poor. A cloying sweetness hits the tongue on the first mouthful, and as that slowly fades there is very little left, no trace of malt or hops and no finish...best avoided if you ask me!",0.0
"UPDATED: JUL 1, 2006 Skunky aroma (undoubtedly a result of the green bottle) is overwhelming. Capped by a slight, quickly receding, white head this brew is light and tightly carbonated with a lingering bitter finish that sits comfortably on the back of the tongue. Average pils. I wish I had a fresh bottle to compare.",0.0

"Draft.  I have a feeling there might have been something wrong with this keg.  The dunkel showed a bit of sourness and other unpleasantry.  Even putting that aside, the underlying flavor was unremarkable.  Having sampled all the Einbecker brews available in the U.S., I would say this is the only one that falls short of brilliance.",0.0

Its good that there is an alternative for those who still need to drive but... come on. Flavour was grainy, dry with a metallic finish. But I guess that was because I sampled it out of the can.

"On tap at the Flying Saucer in KC. Pours a deep brown body with a reddish tint. Dense, two-finger width, light brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a moderate lacing. Aroma is nutty with a medium roast and grainy. Some sweet malts and a light plum on the nose as well. Flavor is roasty and bready. Some dark fruits, nuts, and a hint of citrus with a light sweetness. Finishes slightly dry with a medium lasting aftertaste. Medium bodied, clean, and smooth. Overall, I was anticipating a little more sweetness, but it actually had a nice, clean roasty taste. Not bad at all.",0.0
"A mid golden lager that has enough traces of malt and hops to keep you interested.  Same brewer as the shite Bavaria Premium/Pilsner.  Marginally better than that, but only just.  If it was 40degress outside and this is all I had to drink, Id put up with it.  My sample was in Australia, and came in a narrow 330ml green bottle.",0.0
"Einbecker ""Schwarzbier"" is a ruby brown lager with a sandy slight head.  The aroma is grainy-- roasted barly.  Its fresh and faint.  Its thin in the mouth.  The flavor is of deep malt.  Its lightly bitter and a little funky.  My drinking party and I all agreed that this was a Dunkel, not a Schwarzbier.  Why did they call this a Schwarzbier?",0.0

"Lightly sweet toffee and light raisin nose. The taste is lightly sweet, lightly bitter, toffee and dark fruit malts, herbal hops, some bread dough and a bit of dusty yeast. Just a bit of aspirin on the finish",0.0
"12oz Bottle: Pale yellow, lightly fizzy, some lacing. The nose is strong with husk, alcohol and sweet cheap malts and light floor grade hops. The flavor is either a bit more bitter than I expected, or just kinda zesty and acidic from the carbonation. I thinking the latter, but it almost comes across like a snappy pilsener. Finishes thin, watery, no biscuit or toast or any other yummy bavarian lager type goodies. A typical export lager sold as a cheap alternative to the big boys.",0.0
"Notes of caramel sticky buns on the nose but very faint. Also grainy and slightly hoppy. Flavor followed. Not too bad. The pour is the best part - nice, clear, brown color with light brown, fluffy head.",0.0

"8/21/11. Goofy shaped 11.2oz bottle. Brown pour, lots of red under light, with a big creamy tan head that cuts in half but lasts. Roasted caramel aroma with toffee and biscuits, unfortunately tainted by skunk. Decent flavor of caramel, medium toast malt, and toffee... but also a touch of skunk. The toasted caramel aspect really comes out. Not bad.",0.0
"Delicious.  Dark, slightly sweet, some fruitiness.  As the description says, it is very mild, but found it very drinkable, with a good aftertaste.  Although it is mild and a bit thin,  overall a good dunkel.  Very tasty.",1.0
"Bottle: Had this one years ago:	Small light off white head on top of a clear darker orange to light brown colored beer.	Smell malts, caramel, herbs, hint of hops.

"UPDATED: MAY 23, 2005 Dark brown beer with a small head.  Sweet malt aroma.  Flavor is not as sweet as expected from the aroma.  Malty, smoky, with a lightly bitter and very dry finish.  Decent but not great...... 05-23-2005....  well, it gets better after the first one.   The first one is rough and metallic, but the rest of the sixpack tastes pretty good.  Add a point for that.   Not bad.",0.0
"Bottle 33 cl. Pours a a clear yellow with a small and disappearing head giving it an unatttractive appearance. The aroma is not really pleasant too, Grain and hops, but some unpleasant notes like cardboard and dish-water too. The taste is pretty good compared to what came before tasting, its pretty sweet, a bit fruity, no spices and some grain. The finish is is a bit hoppy, but not very longlasting. Pretty good for such an ultra-cheap supermarket-bock, but not special or groundbreaking at all.",0.0

Pours a muddy caramel color that is not so appetizing. Flavor is a little too sweet with much of the caramel and nuttiness you expect for the style. Would work well late in a meal with a little vanilla ice cream maybe.,0.0

"From a 12 oz. stubby green bottle with a coded freshness date on the bottom of back label.		Poured a clear yellowish golden with a foamy white head that settled into a thin lacing.		Well, this smells like your typical Dutch pale macro lager, that funky grassiness with a little grain husk, a lightly backing sweet pale malts.		The right amount of steady carbonation and a crisp, smooth light bodied mouthfeel.		Bland euro lager tasting, grain husks and sweet, sugary pale malts, the hops are softly bitter and a bit neutral tasting, some light veggie flavor and a dryish sweet grainy finish, passable macro drinkability.		This is cheaper than Heineken with little else to recommend it.",0.0
"Found at carrefour in 250ml bottles, 5.5% abv and exactly like the can pictured. I was wondering with baited breath what ""prestige"" beer tasted like.... and the way this stuff was priced, it certainly wasnt ""prestigious""!

Courtesy of a Porter swilling third party. Thanks man. Clear gold color with white head. The aroma is of sweet lager malt and grain. I think I also get alcohol but oddly no adjuncts.

Bottled 30cl. Courtesy of bierkoning. Appearance: It pours a hazy yellow beer with a small quick diminishing white head. Aroma:  Huge amounts of washing up liquid accompanied by some berries. Artificial. Very interesting and not unpleasant. Flavor and palate: Rather tart. Reminiscent of bubble gum. Artificial. Overly sweet. Overall impression: The aroma is better than the flavor. Not that bad. Underrated in my opinion. Thanks bierkoning!,0.0

"Rating #641, flaske fra Rema1000 drukket som opvarmning til julebrygsmagning 2011  		Udseende: 3/5 	Halvvejs uklar gul l med et drligt holdbart skum.  		Duft: 5/10 	Der er nogle citrusnoter og en smule lavendel, men der er ogs mere ordinr pilsneragtig malt-aroma end i den gennemsnitlige wit. Man havde vel ogs forventet en forskel nr nu der er tale om en alkoholfri udgave af typen.  		Smag: 5/10 	Blomstret og citrusprget smag; overraskende frisk og behagelig. Den sdvanlige ugrede smag fra alkoholfri l, findes kun svagt i baggrunden. llen er derudover dog ikke noget specielt, og eftersmagen er kun meget svagt bitter, og egentlig mest prget af maltsdme.

"Bottle from Frugal McDugal in Nashville, TN. Pours brown with a huge soapy beige head. Aroma of dark bread, caramel, sugary dark fruits, and wet grains. Medium light bodied with a slight thin texture. With the lack of malt backbone and light hopping rate, what is left is bready and nutty malts, with some subtle tea like bitterness. Finishes clean but watery, with some macro european lager characteristics. Not a dunkel, this is a schwarzbier, and a rather ordinary one.",0.0

"I was fortunate enough to enjoy this beer fresh on draught at a wonderful little pub in the Altstadt or ""old town"" of Hannover, Germany called the Broyhan-Haus. Einbeck beers are proudly featured here, and I enjoyed a few nice glasses of this wonderful beer. Einbecker Dunkel has been labeled as a schwarzbier or ""black beer"" for the American market. This really isnt too far fetched, as schwarzbier, is just a darker, roaster, version of Munich Dunkles. Einbecker calls all their beers, bockbier, but their Dunkel is only 4.9% abv, on par with a Munich Dunkel, making this beer stylistically, a dunkle. In fact in Germany, this beer is only called Dunkle, not schwarzbier, so schwarzbier is more marketing for the US market than anything else. Einbecker Dunkle is a very good dark lager. It is a very clean, very malty, nutty, dark lager, with tremendous flavor and character. 		Einbecker Dunkel pours to a very deep/dark brown color, with a slight tan head that fades, and a soft carbonation. When held to the light this beer has very bright deep brown hues. The nose on this beer is just bursting with malt character. Aromas of sweet, toasty, nutty, malt aromas flood the nose. The palate is soft but firm, with big malt flavors. Like the nose this beer is just loaded with sweet, toasty, and nutty malt flavors. The body is clean and round, making this beer very smooth and drinkable. This beer finishes with more big sweet and toasty malt flavors up front, then ends with enough hop bitterness to balance. 		This was an extremely impressive beer. A fantastic version of dunkel. I really enjoyed the wonderful showcase of malt flavors, the toasty and nutty flavors, and hop balance added to this beers class. I would match this beer with classic German fare. This beer would be the perfect match for a dinner of sauerbraten, red cabbage, and spatzel. It would also work very well with a spankenfel pork or chicken dinner, and even as a desert beer with a big, thick slice of Black Forrest cake. Seek this beer out if it is in your market. It is a bit pricey at $9 a six pack, but well worth it in my opinion.",1.0

"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2006 Full bottle, 6/9/06. Poured straight into a dimpled mug, raising a big stiff ecru foam. Kind of a sugary smell. No skunk here, even though it had been sitting on the loose bottle shelf. Definitely not a schwarzbier in taste, but a nice, easy dunkel. A bit thin on mouthfeel, and the sugar and graininess make a cousin to an American dark beer, but not in a bad way Easy drinking (if that head would ever go down), just a bit of bitter after-taste and milk sugar. Relatively light in alcohol and priced as an everyday beer.	Sampler from bottled labeled ""Schwartzbier,"" Mar 6/06 Ah, no wonder this wasnt quite so black as other Schwartz Ive had. Distinctively brown in color and light in body. The green bottle allowed this import to get a bit skunked. Offers some toffee and caramel notes.",0.0

"***review from June 21, 2008***	Another crap beer from the wonderful Beers Around the World mishap. Poured out a crystal clear medium hued solid gold brew, a small white cap, thin ropy lacing and retention just above a skim. The aromas was very dry and quite interesting somehow. Sort of sweet, a large grain content, plastic? and an odd underlying smell. The taste is less than appealing as it is very harsh and very watery with bad hops and a bit of metal. Comes across empty with a weak flavor similar to a light beer. Gassy and foamy too. Slight malt can be found in the aftertaste, which is unsavory. Why bother even finishing this?",0.0

"Pitiful green decapitated penguin of a bottle, clear, bright gold beer with a white beady head which dissipates rapidly.  Pedestrian label, fair cap with a lion and an assurance that this brewery has been bringing forth mediocre beer since 1725.  Lightly sweet malty aroma, with no major problems.  Grassy, a bit astringent, fairly bitter, green-nut sweetness.  Flavor tapers into the finish slowly with straw and sunflower seed notes.  Good CO2. Medium to medium-light body. Some tanginess on the leading edge.  An average Eurolager, but nothing objectionable.  Methinks the cardboard 12 pack kept thisfrom getting skunked.  $12.99/12 at the local Albertsons, so its a respectable choice to bring to the cookout.",0.0

"Aroma: Roasted coffee and chocolate are the first on the scene, followed by hints of licorice and herbs. The lager also has a slight bread character and some dried fruit shining through.	Appearance: It is a good looking lager, with a nice rich looking body, dark but not opaque, slightly amber/brown. The head, although poured with vigor, faded immediately with no hints of it ever being there to begin with. Even with some swirling action to get the lager to release more aroma, there was no more chance of foam.	Taste/Palate: The lager is so light! Surprising for a dark lager with the moniker ""schwarzbier"". There is a smooth texture with a slight carbonated spritz which delicately releases bready and caramel flavors. The lager then totally switches gears and finishes herbal/earthy and very dry. Very refreshing on this awfully hot southern Colorado day.	Overall: Back in NC when I was cutting my teeth on new and interesting beers I worked for a Prussian man with little interest in American brewing. He taught me about German and Czech beers and about balance in brewing. This lager was an early introduction into that world. I find it to be a superb example of balance and finesse.",1.0

"I was fortunate enough to enjoy this beer fresh on draught at a wonderful little pub in the Altstadt or ""old town"" of Hannover, Germany called the Broyhan-Haus. Einbeck beers are proudly featured here, and I enjoyed a few nice glasses of this wonderful beer. Einbecker Dunkel has been labeled as a schwarzbier or ""black beer"" for the American market. This really isnt too far fetched, as schwarzbier, is just a darker, roaster, version of Munich Dunkles. Einbecker calls all their beers, bockbier, but their Dunkel is only 4.9% abv, on par with a Munich Dunkel, making this beer stylistically, a dunkle. In fact in Germany, this beer is only called Dunkle, not schwarzbier, so schwarzbier is more marketing for the US market than anything else. Einbecker Dunkle is a very good dark lager. It is a very clean, very malty, nutty, dark lager, with tremendous flavor and character. 		Einbecker Dunkel pours to a very deep/dark brown color, with a slight tan head that fades, and a soft carbonation. When held to the light this beer has very bright deep brown hues. The nose on this beer is just bursting with malt character. Aromas of sweet, toasty, nutty, malt aromas flood the nose. The palate is soft but firm, with big malt flavors. Like the nose this beer is just loaded with sweet, toasty, and nutty malt flavors. The body is clean and round, making this beer very smooth and drinkable. This beer finishes with more big sweet and toasty malt flavors up front, then ends with enough hop bitterness to balance. 		This was an extremely impressive beer. A fantastic version of dunkel. I really enjoyed the wonderful showcase of malt flavors, the toasty and nutty flavors, and hop balance added to this beers class. I would match this beer with classic German fare. This beer would be the perfect match for a dinner of sauerbraten, red cabbage, and spatzel. It would also work very well with a spankenfel pork or chicken dinner, and even as a desert beer with a big, thick slice of Black Forrest cake. Seek this beer out if it is in your market. It is a bit pricey at $9 a six pack, but well worth it in my opinion.",1.0

"Another standard German pils, nothing new hear.Slight floral aroma,decently bitter, not much hop of malt presence, finshes, slightly tart?",0.0
"Pours with a very dark, almost brown, but really mostly a concentrated amber color.  It is not really black, but it is dark enough, and close enough to black that it is opaque unless it is held up to the light.  When held up to the light the beer shows a brilliantly clear dark ruby color.  The head is a lightly brown, tan color and is initially two fingers thick.  The aroma is sweet up front with almost a berry note to it.  As I delve deeper into the aromatics, I get notes of rich, layered, concentrated malt; notes of toffee and a rich meaty malt character.  The meaty maltiness might actually be a product of a touch of oxidation, but if it is, it is a good thing so far.		The taste is only lightly sweet, with a smooth roast character to it.  The beer rests lightly on the palate for the most part, there is a touch of lingering heft to it and the body itself has a medium fullness to it.  Malt is definitely the focus in this beer, there is almost a nutty character to this brew (similar to what is found in some brown ales), and the finish has a light coffee like roast character to it.  This beer has the malt character I would associate with a Dunkel beer.  Despite this, the beer is quite tasty.  		<font size=-4>Purchased: <a href=http://www.58degrees.com/>58 Degrees & Holding Co., Tucson, AZ<font size=-1>",0.0

Deep ruby color; Thick and rocky head; Good dry Saaz hops mixed with coffee in the aroma. I liked this beer much more then any of the other raters. Very cool little bottle that it comes in.

"(330 ml bottle (best before end of 2006) from Tullys) Decent flavor which doesnt quite live up to aroma...Pours clear dark birch beer brown with a tall tan head.

[draft] A deep red beer with a beutiful head. The flavor is sweet with notes of black currant and yeast. The aroma has a thin start compared to the aroma but then a bitterness from the malt takes over. The malt-flavor is dominated by roasted and black malt. The aroma containes absolutely no sweetness. It ends on a rather dry malt bitter note on the tongue. Not at all what I expected. I thought it would be sweeter and not so bitter.,0.0

"A decent schwartzbier here (says on the label). Average in nearly every catergory save for the look and smell which were a bit higher. The beer pours out a dark brown, nearly black color with a nice foamy head. An aroma of chocolate and subtle dark fruits (dark cherries?) moves foward on to a lighter tasting beer. Nothing heavy handed with this beer, although it is in the darker realm. Flavor is lightly chocolate, some raisins, and some hints of brown sugar. The whole beer is too weak though. Perhaps the brewers were shooting for sessionability? Nice to drink, as I mentioned not heavy in any way but there are better dark beers to be had.",0.0

In a Pils glass, the head formed, short and foamy, but died back quickly to leave a little lace down the glass. In the mouth, the beer was slightly gummy and soapy, leafy, with only a tad of sweetness. Light bodied and floral in the back, followed by a short, lightly bitter aftertaste.

Bottled 30cl. Courtesy of bierkoning. Appearance: It pours a hazy yellow beer with a small quick diminishing white head. Aroma:  Huge amounts of washing up liquid accompanied by some berries. Artificial. Very interesting and not unpleasant. Flavor and palate: Rather tart. Reminiscent of bubble gum. Artificial. Overly sweet. Overall impression: The aroma is better than the flavor. Not that bad. Underrated in my opinion. Thanks bierkoning!,0.0

I tried a couple a few years back when I was a young lad who didn't appreciate the 'finer things in life' and thought it was pretty bitter, but i'm glad I bought a 6 pack, especially for the cheap price.

"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2011 Sampled a green 11.2 oz bottle from Trader Joes labeled as ""Bavaria Holland Beer, Genuine Imported Family Brewed Premium Beer 15334."" I mention that because there seems to be a lot of confusion about which version is common in the USA. It didnt come in a can as pictured, but it definitely wasnt the 8% super-strong, either. Poured a clear straw color with a tall white foam with some staying power and a little lace. My nucleated pint glass maintained a small layer of bubbles the whole time I was drinking it. Aroma of grain and very musky (a word I prefer over ""skunky"") hops, but hey, at least that means they used a bunch in the brewing process. Flavor was typical of a quality pale lager: simple pale malt sweetness with flavorful hops bitterness, no adjuncts, slightly perfumey lager fermentation. Slight bubble gum and pepper yeast esters emerged as it warmed. Extremely dry, refreshing finish. As basic lagers go, this was a pretty good one. One last thing: its frustrating to me that so many breweries worldwide believe they must constantly name themselves in reference to Bavaria. Sure, lager brewing historically originated in Bavaria, Germany...we get it. But hasnt enough time elapsed that breweries elsewhere can take some national pride in their own beers? The Holland aspect of this beer interests me much more than the Bavaria aspect. Holland--and Mexico too, for that matter--have many proud generations of interesting brewing history of their own.

"On tap into a flute glass.		Pours an extremely dark brown, with a slight amount of light penetration. Its a relatively clear brew with a tan head.  Not much to the nose here. Its malty and a tiny bit yeasty like bread. Extremely mild.  Subdued malts on the palate. I do not really find any hops to speak of, which I was expecting in a Schwarzbier. Nice crisp and clean finish.  A light bodied beer with moderate carbonation. It has a silkiness to it though.  My first exposure to a Schwarzbier. A good beer that just surprises with its milder flavors, smells, and ABV considering its appearance. I knew what to expect, and still I was surprised. A great beer for when you want multiple darks.

"UPDATED: NOV 9, 2006 Very dark ruby body that looks a little brown. The head has huge bubbles and a lightly yellowish tint. Teh aroma is funky sweet with fresh peas and some apple core.

Grainy wheat smell at first (that is more like corn, but corn is not an ingredient listed). After sitting a bit, some mild spicy hop appears. Smooth mouthfeel that is more on the boring side of things. The taste is way too light with some grain and hardly any finish. A decent price for a can from Holland at the LCBO, but much prefer Heineken. The head is quite nice though, and that is it.",0.0

"Another decent value from Bavaria. Your average dutch pilslager. Nice malty aroma, with the least bit of skunk. Long mild hop finish. Clean drinking, and not clingy like some of their other brews.

"Aroma: Roasted coffee and chocolate are the first on the scene, followed by hints of licorice and herbs. The lager also has a slight bread character and some dried fruit shining through.	Appearance: It is a good looking lager, with a nice rich looking body, dark but not opaque, slightly amber/brown. The head, although poured with vigor, faded immediately with no hints of it ever being there to begin with. Even with some swirling action to get the lager to release more aroma, there was no more chance of foam.	Taste/Palate: The lager is so light! Surprising for a dark lager with the moniker ""schwarzbier"". There is a smooth texture with a slight carbonated spritz which delicately releases bready and caramel flavors. The lager then totally switches gears and finishes herbal/earthy and very dry. Very refreshing on this awfully hot southern Colorado day.	Overall: Back in NC when I was cutting my teeth on new and interesting beers I worked for a Prussian man with little interest in American brewing. He taught me about German and Czech beers and about balance in brewing. This lager was an early introduction into that world. I find it to be a superb example of balance and finesse.",1.0

Addendum: Smells a bit like old tree bark, and leather. Clearly sepia; beautiful transluscence with a healthy froth. The lace slips down easily like garters on prom night. Delicious malty darjeeling.

"Poured from an Einbecker Schwartzbier bottle, very dark brown with ruby highlights when held to a bright light. A beautiful beer in presentation, the bouquet of malt aromas as well as the complex flavors brought about by the grain bill, hops and underlying water chemistry.  Bitter but not harsh, roasted or toasty but not scorched. The body overall closely matches the flavor and aroma so no expectations are lost although the body could be a little beefier and not hurt this beer.  The DMS and honey (minor) that was picked up on tasting this beer could easily be from storage of this one year old beer.  An excellent example of the style and well worth seeking out.",1.0

[draft] A deep red beer with a beutiful head. The flavor is sweet with notes of black currant and yeast. The aroma has a thin start compared to the aroma but then a bitterness from the malt takes over. The malt-flavor is dominated by roasted and black malt. The aroma containes absolutely no sweetness. It ends on a rather dry malt bitter note on the tongue. Not at all what I expected. I thought it would be sweeter and not so bitter.,0.0

Bottled 30cl. Courtesy of bierkoning. Appearance: It pours a hazy yellow beer with a small quick diminishing white head. Aroma:  Huge amounts of washing up liquid accompanied by some berries.

Not that bad. Underrated in my opinion. Thanks bierkoning!,0.0

"This beer was the catalyst for something of a revelation for me.  A friend of mine offered me one last night, some other friends were sitting around drinking it.

True, it wasnt complex or unique, but thats not the point.  I get it now!!

"(Sampled bottle). Reddish brown colour, bread yeast and just a hint of coffee in the aroma. Flavour leaves you with the impression of drinking this beer in a bakery (this is not necessarily an insult to the beer - its probably an OK accompaniment with a few sandwiches or even Danish pastry). Drier than I expected. Not as good as the Einbecker Ur-Bock Dunkel (and not nearly as good as Aass Bock, which I enjoyed 1 hour earlier) - a bit watery, but still a drinkable dunkel that wont offend anyone.",0.0

"Pours gold with a fluffy, 3 finger, bright white head that has great retention and leaves nice lacing. Aroma is pretty heavy on corn, some wet grain, apple skins and alcohol. Flavor is corn, a vague sorta malty sweetness, alcohol, light salinity and some skunky, grassy hops. Palate is light bodied, slick on entry has a medium carbonation that fits the beer well, and an off dry slightly slick finish, feels much like very soft water on the palate. Not good, but there are definitely worse cut-rate Pale Lagers out there.",0.0

"Aroma: Roasted coffee and chocolate are the first on the scene, followed by hints of licorice and herbs. The lager also has a slight bread character and some dried fruit shining through.	Appearance: It is a good looking lager, with a nice rich looking body, dark but not opaque, slightly amber/brown. The head, although poured with vigor, faded immediately with no hints of it ever being there to begin with. Even with some swirling action to get the lager to release more aroma, there was no more chance of foam.	Taste/Palate: The lager is so light! Surprising for a dark lager with the moniker ""schwarzbier"". There is a smooth texture with a slight carbonated spritz which delicately releases bready and caramel flavors. The lager then totally switches gears and finishes herbal/earthy and very dry. Very refreshing on this awfully hot southern Colorado day.	Overall: Back in NC when I was cutting my teeth on new and interesting beers I worked for a Prussian man with little interest in American brewing. He taught me about German and Czech beers and about balance in brewing. This lager was an early introduction into that world. I find it to be a superb example of balance and finesse.",1.0

"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2006 Full bottle, 6/9/06. Poured straight into a dimpled mug, raising a big stiff ecru foam. Kind of a sugary smell. No skunk here, even though it had been sitting on the loose bottle shelf. Definitely not a schwarzbier in taste, but a nice, easy dunkel. A bit thin on mouthfeel, and the sugar and graininess make a cousin to an American dark beer, but not in a bad way Easy drinking (if that head would ever go down), just a bit of bitter after-taste and milk sugar. Relatively light in alcohol and priced as an everyday beer.	Sampler from bottled labeled ""Schwartzbier,"" Mar 6/06 Ah, no wonder this wasnt quite so black as other Schwartz Ive had. Distinctively brown in color and light in body. The green bottle allowed this import to get a bit skunked. Offers some toffee and caramel notes.",0.0

"I was fortunate enough to enjoy this beer fresh on draught at a wonderful little pub in the Altstadt or ""old town"" of Hannover, Germany called the Broyhan-Haus. Einbeck beers are proudly featured here, and I enjoyed a few nice glasses of this wonderful beer. Einbecker Dunkel has been labeled as a schwarzbier or ""black beer"" for the American market. This really isnt too far fetched, as schwarzbier, is just a darker, roaster, version of Munich Dunkles. Einbecker calls all their beers, bockbier, but their Dunkel is only 4.9% abv, on par with a Munich Dunkel, making this beer stylistically, a dunkle. In fact in Germany, this beer is only called Dunkle, not schwarzbier, so schwarzbier is more marketing for the US market than anything else. Einbecker Dunkle is a very good dark lager. It is a very clean, very malty, nutty, dark lager, with tremendous flavor and character. 		Einbecker Dunkel pours to a very deep/dark brown color, with a slight tan head that fades, and a soft carbonation. When held to the light this beer has very bright deep brown hues. The nose on this beer is just bursting with malt character. Aromas of sweet, toasty, nutty, malt aromas flood the nose. The palate is soft but firm, with big malt flavors. Like the nose this beer is just loaded with sweet, toasty, and nutty malt flavors. The body is clean and round, making this beer very smooth and drinkable. This beer finishes with more big sweet and toasty malt flavors up front, then ends with enough hop bitterness to balance. 		This was an extremely impressive beer. A fantastic version of dunkel. I really enjoyed the wonderful showcase of malt flavors, the toasty and nutty flavors, and hop balance added to this beers class. I would match this beer with classic German fare. This beer would be the perfect match for a dinner of sauerbraten, red cabbage, and spatzel. It would also work very well with a spankenfel pork or chicken dinner, and even as a desert beer with a big, thick slice of Black Forrest cake. Seek this beer out if it is in your market. It is a bit pricey at $9 a six pack, but well worth it in my opinion.",1.0

Its a quick refreshing drink that doesnt stand up to scrutiny. If examined the dry cracker taste starts to get stodgy and a bit chemical. The hop finish is stewed into a washing up-liquid floral melody. Cheap and refreshing straight from the fridge it is - a decent beer it aint. [1.7]",0.0
This beer says average right down the middle. 	Medium taste of hops and malt I come to expect from a pilsner.,0.0
"(bottle) Dark brown to amber colour with a steady foamy off-white head. Shy nose of nuts and roasted malts. Soft bittersweet flavour. Only light to medium bodied, sharp carbonated. Slight taste of roasted malts with notes of coffee and an unexciting dry and hoppy finish.",0.0
"On tap into a flute glass.		Pours an extremely dark brown, with a slight amount of light penetration. Its a relatively clear brew with a tan head.  Not much to the nose here. Its malty and a tiny bit yeasty like bread. Extremely mild.  Subdued malts on the palate. I do not really find any hops to speak of, which I was expecting in a Schwarzbier. Nice crisp and clean finish.  A light bodied beer with moderate carbonation. It has a silkiness to it though.  My first exposure to a Schwarzbier. A good beer that just surprises with its milder flavors, smells, and ABV considering its appearance. I knew what to expect, and still I was surprised. A great beer for when you want multiple darks.		Serving type: on-tap",0.0
"Smooth stuff, I wonder what this would be like on tap. Not particularly Schwartz in color, but quite dark, light tan head peters out. Not as robust as similar DAB product, but at 4.9% one could slide this back all day and not be overpowered by the alcohol or aftertaste.",1.0

330ml bottle labeled Einbecker SchwarzbierPoured an ice tea color brown with a thick head that is slowly settling down. Aroma is slightly roasted with a note of caramel. Body is a bit on the flat side. Flavor is a bit sweet and a bit weak also. Finishes dry. Overall very average and not worthy of future consumption.,0.0
"UPDATED: JUL 12, 2005 Tasted from the bottle, this wasnt as bad as many of the reviews below suggest, and I am not that much of a Euro lager fan. Aroma was hoppy, grassy and a little sour, with a little bit of sweet malt. The aroma, though, faded quickly. In a Pils glass, the head formed, short and foamy, but died back quickly to leave a little lace down the glass. In the mouth, the beer was slightly gummy and soapy, leafy, with only a tad of sweetness. Light bodied and floral in the back, followed by a short, lightly bitter aftertaste. Minimal malt flavours, though, make this a little one dimensional, and mar what could otherwise be a decent lager.",0.0

There were other beers I wanted to try but I was one man picking up a growler and hoping a more widely appealing style would persuade someone to help me with this. Alas no luck.

I dont notice the metallic taste that others have mentioned but in this case it might be a welcome change just because its a taste of any kind!",0.0

"Pitiful green decapitated penguin of a bottle, clear, bright gold beer with a white beady head which dissipates rapidly.  Pedestrian label, fair cap with a lion and an assurance that this brewery has been bringing forth mediocre beer since 1725.  Lightly sweet malty aroma, with no major problems.  Grassy, a bit astringent, fairly bitter, green-nut sweetness.  Flavor tapers into the finish slowly with straw and sunflower seed notes.  Good CO2. Medium to medium-light body. Some tanginess on the leading edge.  An average Eurolager, but nothing objectionable.  Methinks the cardboard 12 pack kept thisfrom getting skunked.  $12.99/12 at the local Albertsons, so its a respectable choice to bring to the cookout.",0.0

"Bottle. Head is initially small, fizzy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is clear medium yellow. Aroma is notes of urine, sour vegetables, and plastic. Flavor is lightly sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is trace sweetness, lightly to moderately bitter, unclean, husky. Light to medium body, watery texture, fizzy carbonation. HWARRRRFFF.  Holy cow.  The aroma is mind-bendingly disgusting.  Ive had a lot of swill lagers in my years, and I can handle swill, since I know what to expect.  But this is the absolute worst aroma I have smelled in a beer in a LONG time.  Does not smell like beer at all, not even bad beer.  Something obviously went wrong with this batch or bottle, but these just rolled into the state so are presumably pretty darn fresh.  No skunkiness, just reeking of green vegetables (green beans mainly) and plastic, with some sharp pee stink in there as well (like asparagus urine! thats it!).  Just absolutely putrid.  It makes my stomach hurt just to smell it.  The taste is almost as dirty.  This is worse than drain pour...its like...wanting to do what Dae-su does at the end of Oldboy. Yeeeesh.  I havent given many 0.5s, but this one has truly earned it.  Congratulations, Hollandia.",0.0
"Bottle at Novare Res.	Labeled as Schwarzbier because Im in the US, but still pours a nice brown with a tan head.  Aroma of maple syrup, hints of malts, and brown sugar.

Slightly bitter-burnt, very toasted flavour over almondy-sweet malts; with yet again a very fresh (malt) aspect. Empty palate, just some malt syrup. Certainly not as bad as some of Bavarias malt liquor offerings, but compared to a real Heller Bock, way too empty. Fresh malts character remains remarkable, however.",0.0

"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2006 Full bottle, 6/9/06. Poured straight into a dimpled mug, raising a big stiff ecru foam. Kind of a sugary smell. No skunk here, even though it had been sitting on the loose bottle shelf. Definitely not a schwarzbier in taste, but a nice, easy dunkel. A bit thin on mouthfeel, and the sugar and graininess make a cousin to an American dark beer, but not in a bad way Easy drinking (if that head would ever go down), just a bit of bitter after-taste and milk sugar. Relatively light in alcohol and priced as an everyday beer.	Sampler from bottled labeled ""Schwartzbier,"" Mar 6/06 Ah, no wonder this wasnt quite so black as other Schwartz Ive had. Distinctively brown in color and light in body. The green bottle allowed this import to get a bit skunked. Offers some toffee and caramel notes.",0.0

A beautiful beer in presentation, the bouquet of malt aromas as well as the complex flavors brought about by the grain bill, hops and underlying water chemistry.  Bitter but not harsh, roasted or toasty but not scorched. The body overall closely matches the flavor and aroma so no expectations are lost although the body could be a little beefier and not hurt this beer.  The DMS and honey (minor) that was picked up on tasting this beer could easily be from storage of this one year old beer.  An excellent example of the style and well worth seeking out.",1.0

"Einbecker ""Schwarzbier"" is a ruby brown lager with a sandy slight head.  The aroma is grainy-- roasted barly.  Its fresh and faint.  Its thin in the mouth.  The flavor is of deep malt.

"On tap at the Flying Saucer in KC. Pours a deep brown body with a reddish tint. Dense, two-finger width, light brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a moderate lacing.

Finishes slightly dry with a medium lasting aftertaste. Medium bodied, clean, and smooth. Overall, I was anticipating a little more sweetness, but it actually had a nice, clean roasty taste. Not bad at all.",0.0
"Structurally, this beer is well put together.  Nice color, much like brown ale, medium darkness.  Can see through it.

Whats left is honey notes and some roasted barley.  Light mouthfeel, light roasting flavor, more honey and generous metallic flavor.  Ends very metallic.  I dont think this is a good example... it really seems as though the beer is just too old.  That or I got the first bottle ever brewed from 1378.",0.0

The pour was a dark, deep brown, which is attractive, but when you can see through to the bottom of the glass, schwarz it is not!  A thin head formed then was gone almost immediately.  There was no real aroma I could put my finger on.  There was a hint of a roast and a little pepper, but nothing remarkable.  The drink itself was very disappointing.  I expect something of this style to be a little thicker and have bold flavor. 		Upon letting this one sit for a while to warm, I found that the flavors did develop nicely and there was a bit of a caramel malt that came out and gave this some character.

"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2011 Sampled a green 11.2 oz bottle from Trader Joes labeled as ""Bavaria Holland Beer, Genuine Imported Family Brewed Premium Beer 15334."" I mention that because there seems to be a lot of confusion about which version is common in the USA. It didnt come in a can as pictured, but it definitely wasnt the 8% super-strong, either. Poured a clear straw color with a tall white foam with some staying power and a little lace. My nucleated pint glass maintained a small layer of bubbles the whole time I was drinking it. Aroma of grain and very musky (a word I prefer over ""skunky"") hops, but hey, at least that means they used a bunch in the brewing process. Flavor was typical of a quality pale lager: simple pale malt sweetness with flavorful hops bitterness, no adjuncts, slightly perfumey lager fermentation. Slight bubble gum and pepper yeast esters emerged as it warmed. Extremely dry, refreshing finish. As basic lagers go, this was a pretty good one. One last thing: its frustrating to me that so many breweries worldwide believe they must constantly name themselves in reference to Bavaria. Sure, lager brewing historically originated in Bavaria, Germany...we get it. But hasnt enough time elapsed that breweries elsewhere can take some national pride in their own beers? The Holland aspect of this beer interests me much more than the Bavaria aspect. Holland--and Mexico too, for that matter--have many proud generations of interesting brewing history of their own.

Medium to thinner body, shorter finish, but decent enough to show notes of some weak grass hops beside its maltiness.

"Bottled (from K Citymarket Kivihaka, Vaasa). Hazy yellow colour, small white head. Aroma is wheat, mild spices as well as some slight cardboardy notes underneath. Flavour is rather similar.

"Dark amber lager look in this schwarzbier. First whiff is full of the typical pilsner smell.  Fortunately, as the beer warms, a malt-molasses aroma predominates.  This rich malt-molassesness dominates the flavor as well.  A tingling sensation encompasses the mouth as the sharp maltness soaks in.  This beer has a large barley-feel. Not bad, but this beer has a quality of staleness.",0.0
"On tap at the Flying Saucer in KC. Pours a deep brown body with a reddish tint. Dense, two-finger width, light brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a moderate lacing.

Finishes slightly dry with a medium lasting aftertaste. Medium bodied, clean, and smooth. Overall, I was anticipating a little more sweetness, but it actually had a nice, clean roasty taste. Not bad at all.",0.0

"Another decent value from Bavaria. Your average dutch pilslager. Nice malty aroma, with the least bit of skunk. Long mild hop finish. Clean drinking, and not clingy like some of their other brews.

"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2006 Full bottle, 6/9/06. Poured straight into a dimpled mug, raising a big stiff ecru foam. Kind of a sugary smell. No skunk here, even though it had been sitting on the loose bottle shelf. Definitely not a schwarzbier in taste, but a nice, easy dunkel. A bit thin on mouthfeel, and the sugar and graininess make a cousin to an American dark beer, but not in a bad way Easy drinking (if that head would ever go down), just a bit of bitter after-taste and milk sugar. Relatively light in alcohol and priced as an everyday beer.	Sampler from bottled labeled ""Schwartzbier,"" Mar 6/06 Ah, no wonder this wasnt quite so black as other Schwartz Ive had.

This is not the best tasting low alcohol beer that I have had but it has the most body and essence.,0.0

"***review from June 21, 2008***	Another crap beer from the wonderful Beers Around the World mishap. Poured out a crystal clear medium hued solid gold brew, a small white cap, thin ropy lacing and retention just above a skim. The aromas was very dry and quite interesting somehow. Sort of sweet, a large grain content, plastic? and an odd underlying smell. The taste is less than appealing as it is very harsh and very watery with bad hops and a bit of metal. Comes across empty with a weak flavor similar to a light beer. Gassy and foamy too. Slight malt can be found in the aftertaste, which is unsavory. Why bother even finishing this?",0.0
Bottle. Clear yellow colour with small white mostly diminishing head. Aroma is malt and hops. Sweet bitter flavor.,0.0
"12oz Bottle: Pale yellow, lightly fizzy, some lacing. The nose is strong with husk, alcohol and sweet cheap malts and light floor grade hops. The flavor is either a bit more bitter than I expected, or just kinda zesty and acidic from the carbonation. I thinking the latter, but it almost comes across like a snappy pilsener. Finishes thin, watery, no biscuit or toast or any other yummy bavarian lager type goodies. A typical export lager sold as a cheap alternative to the big boys.",0.0

"Poured from an Einbecker Schwartzbier bottle, very dark brown with ruby highlights when held to a bright light. A beautiful beer in presentation, the bouquet of malt aromas as well as the complex flavors brought about by the grain bill, hops and underlying water chemistry.  Bitter but not harsh, roasted or toasty but not scorched. The body overall closely matches the flavor and aroma so no expectations are lost although the body could be a little beefier and not hurt this beer.  The DMS and honey (minor) that was picked up on tasting this beer could easily be from storage of this one year old beer.  An excellent example of the style and well worth seeking out.",1.0

Head is nice and creamy and the bottle which seems to be showing its age, still had plenty of head.  The aroma is not great.  Theres a good amount of metaillic smell to this one.  Whats left is honey notes and some roasted barley.  Light mouthfeel, light roasting flavor, more honey and generous metallic flavor.  Ends very metallic.  I dont think this is a good example... it really seems as though the beer is just too old.  That or I got the first bottle ever brewed from 1378.",0.0

"Originally rated October 2009. Bought a six-pack of this one at the LCBO (thank God - on special)... and was not expecting much. Urine smelling malt aromas at first pour. Then, metallic sewage. Then corn. Light golden colour, decent-size white head that is thin and disappears quickly like fizz stuff and does not have any lacing. Thin watery mouthfeel with hardly any taste. Chemical malts maybe, and I actually think Bud Light might be better... ha, ha. Had a few from the can over Monday Night Football and found it gross and unappealing. Now, testing from the glass... even worst. Yukkie poo !",0.0
"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2006 Full bottle, 6/9/06. Poured straight into a dimpled mug, raising a big stiff ecru foam. Kind of a sugary smell. No skunk here, even though it had been sitting on the loose bottle shelf. Definitely not a schwarzbier in taste, but a nice, easy dunkel. A bit thin on mouthfeel, and the sugar and graininess make a cousin to an American dark beer, but not in a bad way Easy drinking (if that head would ever go down), just a bit of bitter after-taste and milk sugar. Relatively light in alcohol and priced as an everyday beer.	Sampler from bottled labeled ""Schwartzbier,"" Mar 6/06 Ah, no wonder this wasnt quite so black as other Schwartz Ive had. Distinctively brown in color and light in body. The green bottle allowed this import to get a bit skunked. Offers some toffee and caramel notes.",0.0

I would be much more inclined to call this an American Dark Lager but I digress. Coffe and copper. Fizzy.  Undeinable corny dry flatness.  Reminds me of St. Paulis Dark only much more flavorful. Cherries and much more of a refined sweetness. However it is still carny. Nose is underwhelming.  Flavors are as well. Corniness immediately. Flat dry palate with lots of leftover chemically adjunctness. Sweet but not artfully.  Very unremarkable. Comes and goes. Flavors remind me of coke. All in all I want my money back but once again I digress.	G-rat,0.0

I found this beer on a low budget trip to NYC. We were in spanish harlem and found six packs for 5 bucks. I hate to admit this but I just wanted a cheap beer to go with my dinner.

"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2011 Sampled a green 11.2 oz bottle from Trader Joes labeled as ""Bavaria Holland Beer, Genuine Imported Family Brewed Premium Beer 15334."" I mention that because there seems to be a lot of confusion about which version is common in the USA. It didnt come in a can as pictured, but it definitely wasnt the 8% super-strong, either. Poured a clear straw color with a tall white foam with some staying power and a little lace. My nucleated pint glass maintained a small layer of bubbles the whole time I was drinking it. Aroma of grain and very musky (a word I prefer over ""skunky"") hops, but hey, at least that means they used a bunch in the brewing process. Flavor was typical of a quality pale lager: simple pale malt sweetness with flavorful hops bitterness, no adjuncts, slightly perfumey lager fermentation. Slight bubble gum and pepper yeast esters emerged as it warmed. Extremely dry, refreshing finish. As basic lagers go, this was a pretty good one. One last thing: its frustrating to me that so many breweries worldwide believe they must constantly name themselves in reference to Bavaria. Sure, lager brewing historically originated in Bavaria, Germany...we get it. But hasnt enough time elapsed that breweries elsewhere can take some national pride in their own beers? The Holland aspect of this beer interests me much more than the Bavaria aspect. Holland--and Mexico too, for that matter--have many proud generations of interesting brewing history of their own. Just a thought.",0.0

Addendum: Smells a bit like old tree bark, and leather. Clearly sepia; beautiful transluscence with a healthy froth. The lace slips down easily like garters on prom night. Delicious malty darjeeling.

"bottled at home in Hannover ; aroma is faint, of nuts, hops and malt, maybe the strongest hint is roasted malt, compared with some nuts.

"I picked this up at the supermarket whilst shopping for cat food and cranberry juice.  Is it a coincidence that it has a bit of a cat box odor... as well as the renal health benefits of cranberries?

"11.2 oz bottle. Poured a medicinal looking reddish/brown with a small frothywhite head and a flat watery body. Aroma was sweet with a slight bit of skunkiness thanks to its green bottle.

Flavor was nothing special, a nice maltiness with a mild hop balance and a slight touch of the skunkiness snuck in there as well.

"A decent schwartzbier here (says on the label). Average in nearly every catergory save for the look and smell which were a bit higher. The beer pours out a dark brown, nearly black color with a nice foamy head. An aroma of chocolate and subtle dark fruits (dark cherries?) moves foward on to a lighter tasting beer. Nothing heavy handed with this beer, although it is in the darker realm. Flavor is lightly chocolate, some raisins, and some hints of brown sugar. The whole beer is too weak though. Perhaps the brewers were shooting for sessionability? Nice to drink, as I mentioned not heavy in any way but there are better dark beers to be had.",0.0
"On tap into a flute glass.		Pours an extremely dark brown, with a slight amount of light penetration. Its a relatively clear brew with a tan head.  Not much to the nose here.

Nice crisp and clean finish.  A light bodied beer with moderate carbonation. It has a silkiness to it though.  My first exposure to a Schwarzbier.

True, it wasnt complex or unique, but thats not the point.  I get it now!!

"Structurally, this beer is well put together.  Nice color, much like brown ale, medium darkness.  Can see through it.  Head is nice and creamy and the bottle which seems to be showing its age, still had plenty of head.  The aroma is not great.  Theres a good amount of metaillic smell to this one.  Whats left is honey notes and some roasted barley.  Light mouthfeel, light roasting flavor, more honey and generous metallic flavor.  Ends very metallic.  I dont think this is a good example... it really seems as though the beer is just too old.  That or I got the first bottle ever brewed from 1378.",0.0

"Bottle, courtesy of fonefan. It pours more or less unclear, pale yellow in color and with a small, white head.

No metallic taste, not unpleasantly vegetal, just crisp and lightly sweet.  Obviously no detectable alcohol.  Why bother?",0.0
"Pours with a very dark, almost brown, but really mostly a concentrated amber color.  It is not really black, but it is dark enough, and close enough to black that it is opaque unless it is held up to the light.  When held up to the light the beer shows a brilliantly clear dark ruby color.  The head is a lightly brown, tan color and is initially two fingers thick.  The aroma is sweet up front with almost a berry note to it.  As I delve deeper into the aromatics, I get notes of rich, layered, concentrated malt; notes of toffee and a rich meaty malt character.  The meaty maltiness might actually be a product of a touch of oxidation, but if it is, it is a good thing so far.		The taste is only lightly sweet, with a smooth roast character to it.  The beer rests lightly on the palate for the most part, there is a touch of lingering heft to it and the body itself has a medium fullness to it.  Malt is definitely the focus in this beer, there is almost a nutty character to this brew (similar to what is found in some brown ales), and the finish has a light coffee like roast character to it.  This beer has the malt character I would associate with a Dunkel beer.  Despite this, the beer is quite tasty.  		<font size=-4>Purchased: <a href=http://www.58degrees.com/>58 Degrees & Holding Co., Tucson, AZ<font size=-1>",0.0

"I was quite pleased with this beer. I tried a couple a few years back when I was a young lad who didn't appreciate the 'finer things in life' and thought it was pretty bitter, but i'm glad I bought a 6 pack, especially for the cheap price. Your usual European lager really. Poured out nice golden, with a decent head. Decent malty flavour with a bitter hint, but no unbareable. Of course, it's not spectacular, but it was well worth it.",0.0

Courtesy of a Porter swilling third party. Thanks man. Clear gold color with white head. The aroma is of sweet lager malt and grain. I think I also get alcohol but oddly no adjuncts.

Frankly I was expecting a skunky import, but it turns out the flavor is very fresh with lots of malt and a bit of corn. Could use more hops in the flavor. Very full mouthfeel, just slightly syrupy on the finish. Not to say this is an epic beer, but Hollandia is certainly one of the kings of the ""Great Minor League"" knowns as pale lager.",0.0
"I was fortunate enough to enjoy this beer fresh on draught at a wonderful little pub in the Altstadt or ""old town"" of Hannover, Germany called the Broyhan-Haus. Einbeck beers are proudly featured here, and I enjoyed a few nice glasses of this wonderful beer. Einbecker Dunkel has been labeled as a schwarzbier or ""black beer"" for the American market. This really isnt too far fetched, as schwarzbier, is just a darker, roaster, version of Munich Dunkles. Einbecker calls all their beers, bockbier, but their Dunkel is only 4.9% abv, on par with a Munich Dunkel, making this beer stylistically, a dunkle. In fact in Germany, this beer is only called Dunkle, not schwarzbier, so schwarzbier is more marketing for the US market than anything else. Einbecker Dunkle is a very good dark lager. It is a very clean, very malty, nutty, dark lager, with tremendous flavor and character. 		Einbecker Dunkel pours to a very deep/dark brown color, with a slight tan head that fades, and a soft carbonation. When held to the light this beer has very bright deep brown hues. The nose on this beer is just bursting with malt character. Aromas of sweet, toasty, nutty, malt aromas flood the nose. The palate is soft but firm, with big malt flavors. Like the nose this beer is just loaded with sweet, toasty, and nutty malt flavors. The body is clean and round, making this beer very smooth and drinkable. This beer finishes with more big sweet and toasty malt flavors up front, then ends with enough hop bitterness to balance. 		This was an extremely impressive beer. A fantastic version of dunkel. I really enjoyed the wonderful showcase of malt flavors, the toasty and nutty flavors, and hop balance added to this beers class. I would match this beer with classic German fare. This beer would be the perfect match for a dinner of sauerbraten, red cabbage, and spatzel. It would also work very well with a spankenfel pork or chicken dinner, and even as a desert beer with a big, thick slice of Black Forrest cake. Seek this beer out if it is in your market. It is a bit pricey at $9 a six pack, but well worth it in my opinion.",1.0

"(Bottle into dimpled mug)  I was rather surprised by this one.  I expected a Schwarzbier to be black and heavy on the roast, to the point where I could taste it.  This had none of that.  The pour was a dark, deep brown, which is attractive, but when you can see through to the bottom of the glass, schwarz it is not!  A thin head formed then was gone almost immediately.  There was no real aroma I could put my finger on.  There was a hint of a roast and a little pepper, but nothing remarkable.  The drink itself was very disappointing.  I expect something of this style to be a little thicker and have bold flavor. 		Upon letting this one sit for a while to warm, I found that the flavors did develop nicely and there was a bit of a caramel malt that came out and gave this some character.  Still not my favorite, but not too bad afterall!",0.0

Nice crisp and clean finish.  A light bodied beer with moderate carbonation. It has a silkiness to it though.  My first exposure to a Schwarzbier.

Courtesy of a Porter swilling third party. Thanks man. Clear gold color with white head. The aroma is of sweet lager malt and grain. I think I also get alcohol but oddly no adjuncts.

I would be much more inclined to call this an American Dark Lager but I digress. Coffe and copper. Fizzy.  Undeinable corny dry flatness.  Reminds me of St. Paulis Dark only much more flavorful. Cherries and much more of a refined sweetness. However it is still carny. Nose is underwhelming.  Flavors are as well. Corniness immediately. Flat dry palate with lots of leftover chemically adjunctness. Sweet but not artfully.  Very unremarkable. Comes and goes. Flavors remind me of coke.

Does not smell like beer at all, not even bad beer.  Something obviously went wrong with this batch or bottle, but these just rolled into the state so are presumably pretty darn fresh.  No skunkiness, just reeking of green vegetables (green beans mainly) and plastic, with some sharp pee stink in there as well (like asparagus urine! thats it!).  Just absolutely putrid.

"Poured from an Einbecker Schwartzbier bottle, very dark brown with ruby highlights when held to a bright light. A beautiful beer in presentation, the bouquet of malt aromas as well as the complex flavors brought about by the grain bill, hops and underlying water chemistry.  Bitter but not harsh, roasted or toasty but not scorched. The body overall closely matches the flavor and aroma so no expectations are lost although the body could be a little beefier and not hurt this beer.  The DMS and honey (minor) that was picked up on tasting this beer could easily be from storage of this one year old beer.  An excellent example of the style and well worth seeking out.",1.0

The pour was a dark, deep brown, which is attractive, but when you can see through to the bottom of the glass, schwarz it is not!  A thin head formed then was gone almost immediately.  There was no real aroma I could put my finger on.  There was a hint of a roast and a little pepper, but nothing remarkable.  The drink itself was very disappointing.  I expect something of this style to be a little thicker and have bold flavor. 		Upon letting this one sit for a while to warm, I found that the flavors did develop nicely and there was a bit of a caramel malt that came out and gave this some character.

The flavor was sweet again with sourdough bread and Cheerios at the core.. more bitter than expected on the edges with grassy notes, amplified by prickly carbonation.. soaked grains on the short, sweet finish.

Nothing exciting, but actually better than a lot of the non-NA Pale Lagers out there.",0.0

The right amount of steady carbonation and a crisp, smooth light bodied mouthfeel.

Does not smell like beer at all, not even bad beer.  Something obviously went wrong with this batch or bottle, but these just rolled into the state so are presumably pretty darn fresh.  No skunkiness, just reeking of green vegetables (green beans mainly) and plastic, with some sharp pee stink in there as well (like asparagus urine! thats it!).  Just absolutely putrid.

"Bottle. Head is initially small, fizzy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is clear medium yellow. Aroma is notes of urine, sour vegetables, and plastic. Flavor is lightly sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is trace sweetness, lightly to moderately bitter, unclean, husky. Light to medium body, watery texture, fizzy carbonation. HWARRRRFFF.  Holy cow.  The aroma is mind-bendingly disgusting.  Ive had a lot of swill lagers in my years, and I can handle swill, since I know what to expect.  But this is the absolute worst aroma I have smelled in a beer in a LONG time.  Does not smell like beer at all, not even bad beer.  Something obviously went wrong with this batch or bottle, but these just rolled into the state so are presumably pretty darn fresh.  No skunkiness, just reeking of green vegetables (green beans mainly) and plastic, with some sharp pee stink in there as well (like asparagus urine! thats it!).  Just absolutely putrid.  It makes my stomach hurt just to smell it.  The taste is almost as dirty.  This is worse than drain pour...its like...wanting to do what Dae-su does at the end of Oldboy. Yeeeesh.

Like an old curmudgeon in a comfy, malty recliner tossing hop flowers in the fireplace. I cant wait to try some more schwarzbiers. I bet this is dynamite when its fresher.	Addendum: Smells a bit like old tree bark, and leather. Clearly sepia; beautiful transluscence with a healthy froth. The lace slips down easily like garters on prom night. Delicious malty darjeeling.

I would be much more inclined to call this an American Dark Lager but I digress. Coffe and copper. Fizzy.  Undeinable corny dry flatness.  Reminds me of St. Paulis Dark only much more flavorful. Cherries and much more of a refined sweetness. However it is still carny. Nose is underwhelming.  Flavors are as well. Corniness immediately. Flat dry palate with lots of leftover chemically adjunctness. Sweet but not artfully.  Very unremarkable. Comes and goes. Flavors remind me of coke. All in all I want my money back but once again I digress.	G-rat,0.0

Head is nice and creamy and the bottle which seems to be showing its age, still had plenty of head.  The aroma is not great.  Theres a good amount of metaillic smell to this one.  Whats left is honey notes and some roasted barley.  Light mouthfeel, light roasting flavor, more honey and generous metallic flavor.  Ends very metallic.  I dont think this is a good example... it really seems as though the beer is just too old.  That or I got the first bottle ever brewed from 1378.",0.0
"Straw color with a tall waxy looking white head. One simple ring of lace. Light pale malt, wort and hint of vinegar in the aroma. Light and mildly effervescent. Watery wort flavor with a light spicy/grassy/hoppy finish. This could be quite satisfying on a really warm day.",0.0
"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2005 I absolutely love this beer as a daily drinker. Its clear with a thin head and is sweet and light which is perfect for a hot day here in Texas. Great thirst quenching beer.

"330 ml. with Schwarzbier label. Clear, darkish brown with copper tints. Small head settles to a ring of bubbles. Aromas of light skunk, metal and molasses.

"Pitiful green decapitated penguin of a bottle, clear, bright gold beer with a white beady head which dissipates rapidly.  Pedestrian label, fair cap with a lion and an assurance that this brewery has been bringing forth mediocre beer since 1725.  Lightly sweet malty aroma, with no major problems.  Grassy, a bit astringent, fairly bitter, green-nut sweetness.  Flavor tapers into the finish slowly with straw and sunflower seed notes.  Good CO2. Medium to medium-light body. Some tanginess on the leading edge.  An average Eurolager, but nothing objectionable.  Methinks the cardboard 12 pack kept thisfrom getting skunked.  $12.99/12 at the local Albertsons, so its a respectable choice to bring to the cookout.",0.0

In the bottle from Beertopia. Pale golden color with an initially thick large white head that dissapates rapidly to a thin sheen of white covering.

[draft] A deep red beer with a beutiful head. The flavor is sweet with notes of black currant and yeast. The aroma has a thin start compared to the aroma but then a bitterness from the malt takes over. The malt-flavor is dominated by roasted and black malt. The aroma containes absolutely no sweetness. It ends on a rather dry malt bitter note on the tongue. Not at all what I expected. I thought it would be sweeter and not so bitter.,0.0
"From a embossed 11.2 oz. green bottle with a notched freshness date on the back label.		Poured a clear reddish cola brown with a nice fluffy head that settled into a thin sudsy, slightly creamy, lacing.		Aromas of caramel covered milk chocolate, a little roasty and earthy mineral.		Good medium carbonation and a crisp, dryish, smooth light bodied mouthfeel.		Tastes of a lightly roasted malts, caramel and milky chocolate, mineral with some toasted grainy metallic edges, a subtle dark fruitiness, not much in the way hops, I wondering if the metallic came from hops and not the grains, and a dryish dark malty finish.

Finishes clean but watery, with some macro european lager characteristics. Not a dunkel, this is a schwarzbier, and a rather ordinary one.",0.0
"***review from June 21, 2008***	Another crap beer from the wonderful Beers Around the World mishap. Poured out a crystal clear medium hued solid gold brew, a small white cap, thin ropy lacing and retention just above a skim. The aromas was very dry and quite interesting somehow. Sort of sweet, a large grain content, plastic? and an odd underlying smell. The taste is less than appealing as it is very harsh and very watery with bad hops and a bit of metal. Comes across empty with a weak flavor similar to a light beer. Gassy and foamy too. Slight malt can be found in the aftertaste, which is unsavory. Why bother even finishing this?",0.0

Interestingly, I think this smells similarly to an American Amber--more malty (with light crystal malt) than bitter.  It doesnt seem like a dunkel to me.  The flavor does revert to style with stronger darker malts coming through on the tongue.  It also has the warming characteristics of a much higher alcohol beer.  The body is light as expected.

[draft] A deep red beer with a beutiful head. The flavor is sweet with notes of black currant and yeast. The aroma has a thin start compared to the aroma but then a bitterness from the malt takes over. The malt-flavor is dominated by roasted and black malt. The aroma containes absolutely no sweetness.

"I was fortunate enough to enjoy this beer fresh on draught at a wonderful little pub in the Altstadt or ""old town"" of Hannover, Germany called the Broyhan-Haus. Einbeck beers are proudly featured here, and I enjoyed a few nice glasses of this wonderful beer. Einbecker Dunkel has been labeled as a schwarzbier or ""black beer"" for the American market. This really isnt too far fetched, as schwarzbier, is just a darker, roaster, version of Munich Dunkles. Einbecker calls all their beers, bockbier, but their Dunkel is only 4.9% abv, on par with a Munich Dunkel, making this beer stylistically, a dunkle. In fact in Germany, this beer is only called Dunkle, not schwarzbier, so schwarzbier is more marketing for the US market than anything else. Einbecker Dunkle is a very good dark lager. It is a very clean, very malty, nutty, dark lager, with tremendous flavor and character. 		Einbecker Dunkel pours to a very deep/dark brown color, with a slight tan head that fades, and a soft carbonation. When held to the light this beer has very bright deep brown hues. The nose on this beer is just bursting with malt character. Aromas of sweet, toasty, nutty, malt aromas flood the nose. The palate is soft but firm, with big malt flavors. Like the nose this beer is just loaded with sweet, toasty, and nutty malt flavors. The body is clean and round, making this beer very smooth and drinkable. This beer finishes with more big sweet and toasty malt flavors up front, then ends with enough hop bitterness to balance. 		This was an extremely impressive beer. A fantastic version of dunkel. I really enjoyed the wonderful showcase of malt flavors, the toasty and nutty flavors, and hop balance added to this beers class. I would match this beer with classic German fare. This beer would be the perfect match for a dinner of sauerbraten, red cabbage, and spatzel. It would also work very well with a spankenfel pork or chicken dinner, and even as a desert beer with a big, thick slice of Black Forrest cake. Seek this beer out if it is in your market. It is a bit pricey at $9 a six pack, but well worth it in my opinion.",1.0

"UPDATED: JUL 12, 2005 Tasted from the bottle, this wasnt as bad as many of the reviews below suggest, and I am not that much of a Euro lager fan. Aroma was hoppy, grassy and a little sour, with a little bit of sweet malt. The aroma, though, faded quickly. In a Pils glass, the head formed, short and foamy, but died back quickly to leave a little lace down the glass. In the mouth, the beer was slightly gummy and soapy, leafy, with only a tad of sweetness. Light bodied and floral in the back, followed by a short, lightly bitter aftertaste. Minimal malt flavours, though, make this a little one dimensional, and mar what could otherwise be a decent lager.",0.0

"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2011 Sampled a green 11.2 oz bottle from Trader Joes labeled as ""Bavaria Holland Beer, Genuine Imported Family Brewed Premium Beer 15334."" I mention that because there seems to be a lot of confusion about which version is common in the USA. It didnt come in a can as pictured, but it definitely wasnt the 8% super-strong, either. Poured a clear straw color with a tall white foam with some staying power and a little lace. My nucleated pint glass maintained a small layer of bubbles the whole time I was drinking it. Aroma of grain and very musky (a word I prefer over ""skunky"") hops, but hey, at least that means they used a bunch in the brewing process. Flavor was typical of a quality pale lager: simple pale malt sweetness with flavorful hops bitterness, no adjuncts, slightly perfumey lager fermentation. Slight bubble gum and pepper yeast esters emerged as it warmed. Extremely dry, refreshing finish. As basic lagers go, this was a pretty good one. One last thing: its frustrating to me that so many breweries worldwide believe they must constantly name themselves in reference to Bavaria. Sure, lager brewing historically originated in Bavaria, Germany...we get it. But hasnt enough time elapsed that breweries elsewhere can take some national pride in their own beers? The Holland aspect of this beer interests me much more than the Bavaria aspect. Holland--and Mexico too, for that matter--have many proud generations of interesting brewing history of their own. Just a thought.",0.0

"A German beer in honor and memory of Dortmunder.  I drank this one tonight and thought what better way to honor Robert than to re-print his rating of the beer.  	Bottled. Dark red/brown colour. Almost no head and no lace at all. Nutty, roastmalty aroma with a hint of liquorice and coffee. Flat, roastmalty taste ending in a nut-bitter finish. Lightbodied and slightly bland. Not enough carbonation, too, therefore underscoring the watery and lightbodied palate-impressions.  	Wellsaid, Robert, you will be missed.",0.0
"Bottle. Pours clear mahogany with a huge fluffy off-white head. The aroma is a little skunked with some noticeable maltiness. The skunkiness in the aroma is too distracting for me to pick out other scents.  Ugh, green bottles should be banned. Anyway, the mouthfeel is thick and creamy. The initial flavour is slightly skunked, much like the aroma. Past the skunkiness, there isnt much flavour and tastes kind of watery up until the finish. The finish is very malty with notes of caramel, bread, and molasses. Skunk persists through the finish, but doesnt completely ruin it. The only thing that seems mildly enjoyable is the finish. The rest of the experience is a chore. This is very sub-par, and the skunkiness isnt helping at all. If they put some effort into bottling in brown bottles Id purchase another one to make sure this tasting wasnt just a rarely spoiled bottle. But alas, its a green bottle, so I instantly dont care to make a second attempt.",0.0
"This beer was the catalyst for something of a revelation for me.  A friend of mine offered me one last night, some other friends were sitting around drinking it.  There was no air conditioning, so it was pretty warm in the apt.  I asked to try some Hollandia, and to my surprise, not only did it not offend, but it was actually rather pleasant.  True, it wasnt complex or unique, but thats not the point.  I get it now!! As far as the beers taste goes, its really just a kinda boring pilsner, not really hoppy even, but I owe something to this beer for teaching me that there really is a time and place for macro brews, even for me.",0.0

"UPDATED: JAN 13, 2005 An initially clean, refreshing and very cheap drink. Light hop and even lighter malt aroma - like dry cracker biscuits. Everything about this is light and laid back - the sweetness is light, the bitterness is light. Its a quick refreshing drink that doesnt stand up to scrutiny.

The beer pours out a dark brown, nearly black color with a nice foamy head. An aroma of chocolate and subtle dark fruits (dark cherries?) moves foward on to a lighter tasting beer. Nothing heavy handed with this beer, although it is in the darker realm. Flavor is lightly chocolate, some raisins, and some hints of brown sugar. The whole beer is too weak though.

Bottled.  A pale golden coloured lager with a half decent white head which dissipates but leaves the odd pool of head.  The aroma is pretty thin; maybe the odd grassy hop.  Taste is fairly watery and thin.  Clean enough but just no charcter.  Not even satisfying on a really hot day like today.,0.0
"Growler Shenandoah Throwdown, 2010.  Pours a hazed copper with a good off white head.  Aroma is citrus- citra hops?  orange, tangerine sharpness with pine mint and a bit of onion and garlic from off columbus hops? and some dank weed.  Flavor is mint, celery salt, garlicy hops, caramel malts, light sweetness hone them pine mint citrus centennial and citra orange and tangerine with little grapefruit oiliness, bitter in the end with a bit more garlic.  Good but the hops were from a  slightly bad harvest.",0.0

Courtesy of a Porter swilling third party. Thanks man. Clear gold color with white head. The aroma is of sweet lager malt and grain. I think I also get alcohol but oddly no adjuncts.

"Structurally, this beer is well put together.  Nice color, much like brown ale, medium darkness.  Can see through it.  Head is nice and creamy and the bottle which seems to be showing its age, still had plenty of head.  The aroma is not great.  Theres a good amount of metaillic smell to this one.  Whats left is honey notes and some roasted barley.  Light mouthfeel, light roasting flavor, more honey and generous metallic flavor.  Ends very metallic.  I dont think this is a good example... it really seems as though the beer is just too old.  That or I got the first bottle ever brewed from 1378.",0.0

"Aroma: Roasted coffee and chocolate are the first on the scene, followed by hints of licorice and herbs. The lager also has a slight bread character and some dried fruit shining through.	Appearance: It is a good looking lager, with a nice rich looking body, dark but not opaque, slightly amber/brown. The head, although poured with vigor, faded immediately with no hints of it ever being there to begin with. Even with some swirling action to get the lager to release more aroma, there was no more chance of foam.	Taste/Palate: The lager is so light! Surprising for a dark lager with the moniker ""schwarzbier"". There is a smooth texture with a slight carbonated spritz which delicately releases bready and caramel flavors. The lager then totally switches gears and finishes herbal/earthy and very dry. Very refreshing on this awfully hot southern Colorado day.	Overall: Back in NC when I was cutting my teeth on new and interesting beers I worked for a Prussian man with little interest in American brewing. He taught me about German and Czech beers and about balance in brewing. This lager was an early introduction into that world. I find it to be a superb example of balance and finesse.",1.0

"Pint, 2 actually, at J-Betskis in Raleigh. Good aroma. Malty, lite smokey. Kind of a seltzer streak in there. A yeasty doughiness too.

"Aroma: Roasted coffee and chocolate are the first on the scene, followed by hints of licorice and herbs. The lager also has a slight bread character and some dried fruit shining through.	Appearance: It is a good looking lager, with a nice rich looking body, dark but not opaque, slightly amber/brown. The head, although poured with vigor, faded immediately with no hints of it ever being there to begin with. Even with some swirling action to get the lager to release more aroma, there was no more chance of foam.	Taste/Palate: The lager is so light! Surprising for a dark lager with the moniker ""schwarzbier"". There is a smooth texture with a slight carbonated spritz which delicately releases bready and caramel flavors. The lager then totally switches gears and finishes herbal/earthy and very dry. Very refreshing on this awfully hot southern Colorado day.	Overall: Back in NC when I was cutting my teeth on new and interesting beers I worked for a Prussian man with little interest in American brewing. He taught me about German and Czech beers and about balance in brewing. This lager was an early introduction into that world. I find it to be a superb example of balance and finesse.",1.0

I would be much more inclined to call this an American Dark Lager but I digress. Coffe and copper. Fizzy.  Undeinable corny dry flatness.  Reminds me of St. Paulis Dark only much more flavorful. Cherries and much more of a refined sweetness. However it is still carny. Nose is underwhelming.  Flavors are as well. Corniness immediately. Flat dry palate with lots of leftover chemically adjunctness. Sweet but not artfully.  Very unremarkable. Comes and goes. Flavors remind me of coke. All in all I want my money back but once again I digress.	G-rat,0.0

"UPDATED: JAN 30, 2005 You know, this is an older bottle, and it seems to have suffered a bit of a drop off in aroma and flavor. Im not going into a lot of detail. this beer does me right though. Its got nice, rich malty flaves, the caramels, and sweetened malt-o-meal. Nice toffee aroma, with maple. I love the blackened grains, stark and bitter and smoky. Like an old curmudgeon in a comfy, malty recliner tossing hop flowers in the fireplace. I cant wait to try some more schwarzbiers. I bet this is dynamite when its fresher.	Addendum: Smells a bit like old tree bark, and leather. Clearly sepia; beautiful transluscence with a healthy froth. The lace slips down easily like garters on prom night. Delicious malty darjeeling. Unsweetened baking chocolate, walnuts, dark brown sugar. Give me a pitcher with rye bread, radish, and a nutty, strong cheese.",1.0

In the bottle from Beertopia. Pale golden color with an initially thick large white head that dissapates rapidly to a thin sheen of white covering. Straw-like aroma mixed with a mild dash of green hop citrus rind aroma. Thin and crisp but with a substantial biting hop bitterness. Dry and crisp finish. Solid pils.,0.0
"33cl Can from AH, at my own ""Nectar of the Gods tasting"". Hazy pale yellow colour, white head. Aroma of banana candy and lemon juice, dishwash soap.

Aroma is nice, sweet fruit and malt.  Flavor is better than expected considering the low price.  Sweet malt and fruit, very smooth, and a touch of bitterness at the end.  Gave me the impression of a watered down Belgian Blonde instead of pilsener.  Tasted decent to me, but maybe I was just happy to have something to put out the fire from that chili.",0.0

Weaker sourish corn notes in the flavor, industrial honey malt, it was not grainy and unclean though. Medium to thinner body, shorter finish, but decent enough to show notes of some weak grass hops beside its maltiness.

"Bottled.  Pours a solid light yellow with thick head and high carbonation.  Smells like most Holland beers, but very lightly.  This beer had a strong initial cereal taste, which then transitioned to a water aftertaste.

"Rating #641, flaske fra Rema1000 drukket som opvarmning til julebrygsmagning 2011  		Udseende: 3/5 	Halvvejs uklar gul l med et drligt holdbart skum.

"Aroma: Roasted coffee and chocolate are the first on the scene, followed by hints of licorice and herbs. The lager also has a slight bread character and some dried fruit shining through.	Appearance: It is a good looking lager, with a nice rich looking body, dark but not opaque, slightly amber/brown. The head, although poured with vigor, faded immediately with no hints of it ever being there to begin with. Even with some swirling action to get the lager to release more aroma, there was no more chance of foam.	Taste/Palate: The lager is so light! Surprising for a dark lager with the moniker ""schwarzbier"". There is a smooth texture with a slight carbonated spritz which delicately releases bready and caramel flavors. The lager then totally switches gears and finishes herbal/earthy and very dry. Very refreshing on this awfully hot southern Colorado day.	Overall: Back in NC when I was cutting my teeth on new and interesting beers I worked for a Prussian man with little interest in American brewing. He taught me about German and Czech beers and about balance in brewing. This lager was an early introduction into that world. I find it to be a superb example of balance and finesse.",1.0

"From a embossed 11.2 oz. green bottle with a notched freshness date on the back label.		Poured a clear reddish cola brown with a nice fluffy head that settled into a thin sudsy, slightly creamy, lacing.		Aromas of caramel covered milk chocolate, a little roasty and earthy mineral.		Good medium carbonation and a crisp, dryish, smooth light bodied mouthfeel.		Tastes of a lightly roasted malts, caramel and milky chocolate, mineral with some toasted grainy metallic edges, a subtle dark fruitiness, not much in the way hops, I wondering if the metallic came from hops and not the grains, and a dryish dark malty finish.

The initial flavour is slightly skunked, much like the aroma. Past the skunkiness, there isnt much flavour and tastes kind of watery up until the finish. The finish is very malty with notes of caramel, bread, and molasses. Skunk persists through the finish, but doesnt completely ruin it. The only thing that seems mildly enjoyable is the finish. The rest of the experience is a chore. This is very sub-par, and the skunkiness isnt helping at all.

"I was fortunate enough to enjoy this beer fresh on draught at a wonderful little pub in the Altstadt or ""old town"" of Hannover, Germany called the Broyhan-Haus. Einbeck beers are proudly featured here, and I enjoyed a few nice glasses of this wonderful beer. Einbecker Dunkel has been labeled as a schwarzbier or ""black beer"" for the American market. This really isnt too far fetched, as schwarzbier, is just a darker, roaster, version of Munich Dunkles. Einbecker calls all their beers, bockbier, but their Dunkel is only 4.9% abv, on par with a Munich Dunkel, making this beer stylistically, a dunkle. In fact in Germany, this beer is only called Dunkle, not schwarzbier, so schwarzbier is more marketing for the US market than anything else. Einbecker Dunkle is a very good dark lager. It is a very clean, very malty, nutty, dark lager, with tremendous flavor and character. 		Einbecker Dunkel pours to a very deep/dark brown color, with a slight tan head that fades, and a soft carbonation. When held to the light this beer has very bright deep brown hues. The nose on this beer is just bursting with malt character. Aromas of sweet, toasty, nutty, malt aromas flood the nose. The palate is soft but firm, with big malt flavors. Like the nose this beer is just loaded with sweet, toasty, and nutty malt flavors. The body is clean and round, making this beer very smooth and drinkable. This beer finishes with more big sweet and toasty malt flavors up front, then ends with enough hop bitterness to balance. 		This was an extremely impressive beer. A fantastic version of dunkel. I really enjoyed the wonderful showcase of malt flavors, the toasty and nutty flavors, and hop balance added to this beers class. I would match this beer with classic German fare. This beer would be the perfect match for a dinner of sauerbraten, red cabbage, and spatzel. It would also work very well with a spankenfel pork or chicken dinner, and even as a desert beer with a big, thick slice of Black Forrest cake. Seek this beer out if it is in your market. It is a bit pricey at $9 a six pack, but well worth it in my opinion.",1.0

Aroma is roasty and sweet of malts with some plum and raisin undertones. Flavors are sweet and lightly dry of a roasted quality that aren't withstanding some length or boldness, not that its really all that necessary for the style but it seems to be over quickly. There's some nice subtlities to the roastyness with toffee, caramel, dark fruits, and grasses that help keep its pleasing tone, the finish is fluffy clean and slightly dry which is nice as well. Slight metalic bittering sneaks in nearer the finish. Feel is lightly creamy with a smooth light carbonation and hold of drying qualities within its medium body.

"99p can labelled Lynx Pilsner, but reading between the lines, this is whats in my glass. Clear yellow with a dying head of fluff. Sweetcorn, blade of grass and peanut butter aroma. Once warm I can detect Munich-like biscuity pale malt and herbal hop traces, and something lemony. Really. Loads of sweetcorn and cornflake beyond, no hop or malt flavours discernible. Sweet and adjuncty, but no off notes to justify tipping it. Cornflake aftertaste. Nowhere near shit enough to make it into my bottom 100. Refreshing and brainless.",0.0

Grassy, a bit astringent, fairly bitter, green-nut sweetness.  Flavor tapers into the finish slowly with straw and sunflower seed notes.  Good CO2. Medium to medium-light body. Some tanginess on the leading edge.  An average Eurolager, but nothing objectionable.  Methinks the cardboard 12 pack kept thisfrom getting skunked.  $12.99/12 at the local Albertsons, so its a respectable choice to bring to the cookout.",0.0
Bottled 30cl. Courtesy of bierkoning. Appearance: It pours a hazy yellow beer with a small quick diminishing white head. Aroma:  Huge amounts of washing up liquid accompanied by some berries.

"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2011 Sampled a green 11.2 oz bottle from Trader Joes labeled as ""Bavaria Holland Beer, Genuine Imported Family Brewed Premium Beer 15334."" I mention that because there seems to be a lot of confusion about which version is common in the USA. It didnt come in a can as pictured, but it definitely wasnt the 8% super-strong, either. Poured a clear straw color with a tall white foam with some staying power and a little lace. My nucleated pint glass maintained a small layer of bubbles the whole time I was drinking it. Aroma of grain and very musky (a word I prefer over ""skunky"") hops, but hey, at least that means they used a bunch in the brewing process. Flavor was typical of a quality pale lager: simple pale malt sweetness with flavorful hops bitterness, no adjuncts, slightly perfumey lager fermentation. Slight bubble gum and pepper yeast esters emerged as it warmed. Extremely dry, refreshing finish. As basic lagers go, this was a pretty good one. One last thing: its frustrating to me that so many breweries worldwide believe they must constantly name themselves in reference to Bavaria. Sure, lager brewing historically originated in Bavaria, Germany...we get it. But hasnt enough time elapsed that breweries elsewhere can take some national pride in their own beers? The Holland aspect of this beer interests me much more than the Bavaria aspect. Holland--and Mexico too, for that matter--have many proud generations of interesting brewing history of their own. Just a thought.",0.0

"(Bottle into dimpled mug)  I was rather surprised by this one.  I expected a Schwarzbier to be black and heavy on the roast, to the point where I could taste it.  This had none of that.  The pour was a dark, deep brown, which is attractive, but when you can see through to the bottom of the glass, schwarz it is not!  A thin head formed then was gone almost immediately.  There was no real aroma I could put my finger on.  There was a hint of a roast and a little pepper, but nothing remarkable.  The drink itself was very disappointing.  I expect something of this style to be a little thicker and have bold flavor. 		Upon letting this one sit for a while to warm, I found that the flavors did develop nicely and there was a bit of a caramel malt that came out and gave this some character.

The aroma is sweet up front with almost a berry note to it.  As I delve deeper into the aromatics, I get notes of rich, layered, concentrated malt; notes of toffee and a rich meaty malt character.  The meaty maltiness might actually be a product of a touch of oxidation, but if it is, it is a good thing so far.		The taste is only lightly sweet, with a smooth roast character to it.  The beer rests lightly on the palate for the most part, there is a touch of lingering heft to it and the body itself has a medium fullness to it.  Malt is definitely the focus in this beer, there is almost a nutty character to this brew (similar to what is found in some brown ales), and the finish has a light coffee like roast character to it.  This beer has the malt character I would associate with a Dunkel beer.  Despite this, the beer is quite tasty.  		<font size=-4>Purchased: <a href=http://www.58degrees.com/>58 Degrees & Holding Co., Tucson, AZ<font size=-1>",0.0

"Bought at Franprix.  50 cL can for 1 euro.  My can says 5% alcohol, not 4.7%.    		Smells better than most beers this price from the Franprix hobo beer section.  Tastes a little sweeter than most crappy pale lagers.  Gross cheap beer aftertaste, as would be expected. But you can pour it into a glass and still drink it without gagging.  It tastes even better slammed out of the can.  It reminds me of my fondest Miller Lite memories.  		Better than some of the other 1 euro beers.  Better than a can of 1664 too.",0.0

"Pitiful green decapitated penguin of a bottle, clear, bright gold beer with a white beady head which dissipates rapidly.  Pedestrian label, fair cap with a lion and an assurance that this brewery has been bringing forth mediocre beer since 1725.  Lightly sweet malty aroma, with no major problems.  Grassy, a bit astringent, fairly bitter, green-nut sweetness.  Flavor tapers into the finish slowly with straw and sunflower seed notes.  Good CO2. Medium to medium-light body. Some tanginess on the leading edge.  An average Eurolager, but nothing objectionable.  Methinks the cardboard 12 pack kept thisfrom getting skunked.  $12.99/12 at the local Albertsons, so its a respectable choice to bring to the cookout.",0.0

Ive had a lot of swill lagers in my years, and I can handle swill, since I know what to expect.  But this is the absolute worst aroma I have smelled in a beer in a LONG time.  Does not smell like beer at all, not even bad beer.  Something obviously went wrong with this batch or bottle, but these just rolled into the state so are presumably pretty darn fresh.  No skunkiness, just reeking of green vegetables (green beans mainly) and plastic, with some sharp pee stink in there as well (like asparagus urine! thats it!).  Just absolutely putrid.

"Bottle:  Picked this beauty up at a friends house.  Skunk aromas pours out of the bottle as quickly as the liquid into the glass.  Light malt barely sneaks by the skunk.  Ive smelled skunkier beers so it can get worse.  Therefore I wont give it a 1 in aroma.  Pours a pale yellow with a white head that has some decent retention.

Bottled 30cl. Courtesy of bierkoning. Appearance: It pours a hazy yellow beer with a small quick diminishing white head. Aroma:  Huge amounts of washing up liquid accompanied by some berries.

"Pours with a very dark, almost brown, but really mostly a concentrated amber color.  It is not really black, but it is dark enough, and close enough to black that it is opaque unless it is held up to the light.  When held up to the light the beer shows a brilliantly clear dark ruby color.  The head is a lightly brown, tan color and is initially two fingers thick.  The aroma is sweet up front with almost a berry note to it.  As I delve deeper into the aromatics, I get notes of rich, layered, concentrated malt; notes of toffee and a rich meaty malt character.  The meaty maltiness might actually be a product of a touch of oxidation, but if it is, it is a good thing so far.		The taste is only lightly sweet, with a smooth roast character to it.  The beer rests lightly on the palate for the most part, there is a touch of lingering heft to it and the body itself has a medium fullness to it.  Malt is definitely the focus in this beer, there is almost a nutty character to this brew (similar to what is found in some brown ales), and the finish has a light coffee like roast character to it.  This beer has the malt character I would associate with a Dunkel beer.  Despite this, the beer is quite tasty.  		<font size=-4>Purchased: <a href=http://www.58degrees.com/>58 Degrees & Holding Co., Tucson, AZ<font size=-1>",0.0

"I was fortunate enough to enjoy this beer fresh on draught at a wonderful little pub in the Altstadt or ""old town"" of Hannover, Germany called the Broyhan-Haus. Einbeck beers are proudly featured here, and I enjoyed a few nice glasses of this wonderful beer. Einbecker Dunkel has been labeled as a schwarzbier or ""black beer"" for the American market. This really isnt too far fetched, as schwarzbier, is just a darker, roaster, version of Munich Dunkles. Einbecker calls all their beers, bockbier, but their Dunkel is only 4.9% abv, on par with a Munich Dunkel, making this beer stylistically, a dunkle. In fact in Germany, this beer is only called Dunkle, not schwarzbier, so schwarzbier is more marketing for the US market than anything else. Einbecker Dunkle is a very good dark lager. It is a very clean, very malty, nutty, dark lager, with tremendous flavor and character. 		Einbecker Dunkel pours to a very deep/dark brown color, with a slight tan head that fades, and a soft carbonation. When held to the light this beer has very bright deep brown hues. The nose on this beer is just bursting with malt character. Aromas of sweet, toasty, nutty, malt aromas flood the nose. The palate is soft but firm, with big malt flavors. Like the nose this beer is just loaded with sweet, toasty, and nutty malt flavors. The body is clean and round, making this beer very smooth and drinkable. This beer finishes with more big sweet and toasty malt flavors up front, then ends with enough hop bitterness to balance. 		This was an extremely impressive beer. A fantastic version of dunkel. I really enjoyed the wonderful showcase of malt flavors, the toasty and nutty flavors, and hop balance added to this beers class. I would match this beer with classic German fare. This beer would be the perfect match for a dinner of sauerbraten, red cabbage, and spatzel. It would also work very well with a spankenfel pork or chicken dinner, and even as a desert beer with a big, thick slice of Black Forrest cake. Seek this beer out if it is in your market. It is a bit pricey at $9 a six pack, but well worth it in my opinion.",1.0

"(Bottle into dimpled mug)  I was rather surprised by this one.  I expected a Schwarzbier to be black and heavy on the roast, to the point where I could taste it.  This had none of that.  The pour was a dark, deep brown, which is attractive, but when you can see through to the bottom of the glass, schwarz it is not!  A thin head formed then was gone almost immediately.  There was no real aroma I could put my finger on.  There was a hint of a roast and a little pepper, but nothing remarkable.  The drink itself was very disappointing.  I expect something of this style to be a little thicker and have bold flavor. 		Upon letting this one sit for a while to warm, I found that the flavors did develop nicely and there was a bit of a caramel malt that came out and gave this some character.  Still not my favorite, but not too bad afterall!",0.0

"Bottle. Pours clear mahogany with a huge fluffy off-white head. The aroma is a little skunked with some noticeable maltiness. The skunkiness in the aroma is too distracting for me to pick out other scents.  Ugh, green bottles should be banned. Anyway, the mouthfeel is thick and creamy. The initial flavour is slightly skunked, much like the aroma. Past the skunkiness, there isnt much flavour and tastes kind of watery up until the finish. The finish is very malty with notes of caramel, bread, and molasses. Skunk persists through the finish, but doesnt completely ruin it. The only thing that seems mildly enjoyable is the finish. The rest of the experience is a chore. This is very sub-par, and the skunkiness isnt helping at all. If they put some effort into bottling in brown bottles Id purchase another one to make sure this tasting wasnt just a rarely spoiled bottle.

"This pours a dark brown with some light head which quickly dissipates. A dark malty aroma is present, though its not significant.

There was no air conditioning, so it was pretty warm in the apt.  I asked to try some Hollandia, and to my surprise, not only did it not offend, but it was actually rather pleasant.  True, it wasnt complex or unique, but thats not the point.  I get it now!!

"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2011 Sampled a green 11.2 oz bottle from Trader Joes labeled as ""Bavaria Holland Beer, Genuine Imported Family Brewed Premium Beer 15334."" I mention that because there seems to be a lot of confusion about which version is common in the USA. It didnt come in a can as pictured, but it definitely wasnt the 8% super-strong, either. Poured a clear straw color with a tall white foam with some staying power and a little lace. My nucleated pint glass maintained a small layer of bubbles the whole time I was drinking it. Aroma of grain and very musky (a word I prefer over ""skunky"") hops, but hey, at least that means they used a bunch in the brewing process. Flavor was typical of a quality pale lager: simple pale malt sweetness with flavorful hops bitterness, no adjuncts, slightly perfumey lager fermentation. Slight bubble gum and pepper yeast esters emerged as it warmed. Extremely dry, refreshing finish. As basic lagers go, this was a pretty good one. One last thing: its frustrating to me that so many breweries worldwide believe they must constantly name themselves in reference to Bavaria. Sure, lager brewing historically originated in Bavaria, Germany...we get it. But hasnt enough time elapsed that breweries elsewhere can take some national pride in their own beers? The Holland aspect of this beer interests me much more than the Bavaria aspect. Holland--and Mexico too, for that matter--have many proud generations of interesting brewing history of their own. Just a thought.",0.0

"Bottle. Huh, I get kind of ticked to see that the US gets one label and Europe gets another for the same, dang beer.

"UPDATED: JAN 13, 2005 An initially clean, refreshing and very cheap drink. Light hop and even lighter malt aroma - like dry cracker biscuits. Everything about this is light and laid back - the sweetness is light, the bitterness is light. Its a quick refreshing drink that doesnt stand up to scrutiny. If examined the dry cracker taste starts to get stodgy and a bit chemical. The hop finish is stewed into a washing up-liquid floral melody. Cheap and refreshing straight from the fridge it is - a decent beer it aint.",0.0
"99p can labelled Lynx Pilsner, but reading between the lines, this is whats in my glass. Clear yellow with a dying head of fluff. Sweetcorn, blade of grass and peanut butter aroma. Once warm I can detect Munich-like biscuity pale malt and herbal hop traces, and something lemony. Really. Loads of sweetcorn and cornflake beyond, no hop or malt flavours discernible. Sweet and adjuncty, but no off notes to justify tipping it. Cornflake aftertaste. Nowhere near shit enough to make it into my bottom 100. Refreshing and brainless.",0.0

"(Bottle into dimpled mug)  I was rather surprised by this one.  I expected a Schwarzbier to be black and heavy on the roast, to the point where I could taste it.  This had none of that.  The pour was a dark, deep brown, which is attractive, but when you can see through to the bottom of the glass, schwarz it is not!  A thin head formed then was gone almost immediately.  There was no real aroma I could put my finger on.  There was a hint of a roast and a little pepper, but nothing remarkable.  The drink itself was very disappointing.  I expect something of this style to be a little thicker and have bold flavor. 		Upon letting this one sit for a while to warm, I found that the flavors did develop nicely and there was a bit of a caramel malt that came out and gave this some character.  Still not my favorite, but not too bad afterall!",0.0

Ive had a lot of swill lagers in my years, and I can handle swill, since I know what to expect.  But this is the absolute worst aroma I have smelled in a beer in a LONG time.  Does not smell like beer at all, not even bad beer.  Something obviously went wrong with this batch or bottle, but these just rolled into the state so are presumably pretty darn fresh.  No skunkiness, just reeking of green vegetables (green beans mainly) and plastic, with some sharp pee stink in there as well (like asparagus urine! thats it!).  Just absolutely putrid.  It makes my stomach hurt just to smell it.  The taste is almost as dirty.  This is worse than drain pour...its like...wanting to do what Dae-su does at the end of Oldboy. Yeeeesh.  I havent given many 0.5s, but this one has truly earned it.  Congratulations, Hollandia.",0.0

Hey for the price it is okay. Asda (Walmart subsiduary) is selling this baby for 90pence for four cans. Good as a chaser with stronger stuff.

There were other beers I wanted to try but I was one man picking up a growler and hoping a more widely appealing style would persuade someone to help me with this. Alas no luck.

"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2011 Sampled a green 11.2 oz bottle from Trader Joes labeled as ""Bavaria Holland Beer, Genuine Imported Family Brewed Premium Beer 15334."" I mention that because there seems to be a lot of confusion about which version is common in the USA. It didnt come in a can as pictured, but it definitely wasnt the 8% super-strong, either. Poured a clear straw color with a tall white foam with some staying power and a little lace. My nucleated pint glass maintained a small layer of bubbles the whole time I was drinking it. Aroma of grain and very musky (a word I prefer over ""skunky"") hops, but hey, at least that means they used a bunch in the brewing process. Flavor was typical of a quality pale lager: simple pale malt sweetness with flavorful hops bitterness, no adjuncts, slightly perfumey lager fermentation. Slight bubble gum and pepper yeast esters emerged as it warmed. Extremely dry, refreshing finish. As basic lagers go, this was a pretty good one. One last thing: its frustrating to me that so many breweries worldwide believe they must constantly name themselves in reference to Bavaria. Sure, lager brewing historically originated in Bavaria, Germany...we get it. But hasnt enough time elapsed that breweries elsewhere can take some national pride in their own beers? The Holland aspect of this beer interests me much more than the Bavaria aspect. Holland--and Mexico too, for that matter--have many proud generations of interesting brewing history of their own. Just a thought.",0.0
"The liquid is a dark amber and nearly clear.  There is some fine lace left on the glass after each sip.		Interestingly, I think this smells similarly to an American Amber--more malty (with light crystal malt) than bitter.  It doesnt seem like a dunkel to me.  The flavor does revert to style with stronger darker malts coming through on the tongue.  It also has the warming characteristics of a much higher alcohol beer.  The body is light as expected.  The aftertaste is bland but well-balanced.",0.0

"Bottled.  Poured clear light-medium golden with a well-retained cap of white head.  The aroma was sweet with toasted grains and bready notes accented by a little grassy character.. smells like the brewing process was cut short rather than extracing the booze after the fact.  The flavor was sweet again with sourdough bread and Cheerios at the core.. more bitter than expected on the edges with grassy notes, amplified by prickly carbonation.. soaked grains on the short, sweet finish.  Light-bodied and rather sharp on the palate (combination of bitterness, some sourness, and carbonation).. not bad overall.",0.0

"In the bottle from the Huber Haus. A dark, dark brown color with a thick ivory head. This is just a beautiful beer. Strong aroma of bread dough and caramel maltiness. Good roasted flavor, but also tastes like malted milk. Has a medium body. Nice rings of lacing. Has a very low hop content. This was good in spite of the green bottle!

"Bottle. Pours clear mahogany with a huge fluffy off-white head. The aroma is a little skunked with some noticeable maltiness. The skunkiness in the aroma is too distracting for me to pick out other scents.  Ugh, green bottles should be banned. Anyway, the mouthfeel is thick and creamy. The initial flavour is slightly skunked, much like the aroma. Past the skunkiness, there isnt much flavour and tastes kind of watery up until the finish. The finish is very malty with notes of caramel, bread, and molasses. Skunk persists through the finish, but doesnt completely ruin it. The only thing that seems mildly enjoyable is the finish. The rest of the experience is a chore. This is very sub-par, and the skunkiness isnt helping at all. If they put some effort into bottling in brown bottles Id purchase another one to make sure this tasting wasnt just a rarely spoiled bottle.

Nothing heavy handed with this beer, although it is in the darker realm. Flavor is lightly chocolate, some raisins, and some hints of brown sugar. The whole beer is too weak though.

"I was fortunate enough to enjoy this beer fresh on draught at a wonderful little pub in the Altstadt or ""old town"" of Hannover, Germany called the Broyhan-Haus. Einbeck beers are proudly featured here, and I enjoyed a few nice glasses of this wonderful beer. Einbecker Dunkel has been labeled as a schwarzbier or ""black beer"" for the American market. This really isnt too far fetched, as schwarzbier, is just a darker, roaster, version of Munich Dunkles. Einbecker calls all their beers, bockbier, but their Dunkel is only 4.9% abv, on par with a Munich Dunkel, making this beer stylistically, a dunkle. In fact in Germany, this beer is only called Dunkle, not schwarzbier, so schwarzbier is more marketing for the US market than anything else. Einbecker Dunkle is a very good dark lager. It is a very clean, very malty, nutty, dark lager, with tremendous flavor and character. 		Einbecker Dunkel pours to a very deep/dark brown color, with a slight tan head that fades, and a soft carbonation. When held to the light this beer has very bright deep brown hues. The nose on this beer is just bursting with malt character. Aromas of sweet, toasty, nutty, malt aromas flood the nose. The palate is soft but firm, with big malt flavors. Like the nose this beer is just loaded with sweet, toasty, and nutty malt flavors. The body is clean and round, making this beer very smooth and drinkable. This beer finishes with more big sweet and toasty malt flavors up front, then ends with enough hop bitterness to balance. 		This was an extremely impressive beer. A fantastic version of dunkel. I really enjoyed the wonderful showcase of malt flavors, the toasty and nutty flavors, and hop balance added to this beers class. I would match this beer with classic German fare. This beer would be the perfect match for a dinner of sauerbraten, red cabbage, and spatzel. It would also work very well with a spankenfel pork or chicken dinner, and even as a desert beer with a big, thick slice of Black Forrest cake. Seek this beer out if it is in your market. It is a bit pricey at $9 a six pack, but well worth it in my opinion.",1.0

Body is appropriate, nice crispness, I suppose it gets a 2 since its so light and has a weak finish.  Like the other Aldi brand beer, the German one, this was not bad at first, but after a few minutes its crap.",0.0

Bottle. This is a pretty good beer. Better than the ratings it is receiving. I know I am favored to these styles beers but to me it was good. Really dark in color. Nice head and lace. Wonderful nutty malt flavor. Slight toast aroma with a tax of coffee. Good stuff.,0.0
Pale yellow colour. Big white frothy head. Pretty big malty aroma. The taste is sweet but with a nice bitter finish. Its hard to imbue a non-alcoholic lager with any sort of character. This one is a little hoppier than most but not enough to really make it stand out. Nice try though.,0.0

"Bottle from Frugal McDugal in Nashville, TN. Pours brown with a huge soapy beige head. Aroma of dark bread, caramel, sugary dark fruits, and wet grains.

Finishes clean but watery, with some macro european lager characteristics. Not a dunkel, this is a schwarzbier, and a rather ordinary one.",0.0

Bottled 30cl. Courtesy of bierkoning. Appearance: It pours a hazy yellow beer with a small quick diminishing white head. Aroma:  Huge amounts of washing up liquid accompanied by some berries. Artificial. Very interesting and not unpleasant. Flavor and palate: Rather tart. Reminiscent of bubble gum. Artificial. Overly sweet. Overall impression: The aroma is better than the flavor. Not that bad. Underrated in my opinion. Thanks bierkoning!,0.0

"Pours with a very dark, almost brown, but really mostly a concentrated amber color.  It is not really black, but it is dark enough, and close enough to black that it is opaque unless it is held up to the light.  When held up to the light the beer shows a brilliantly clear dark ruby color.  The head is a lightly brown, tan color and is initially two fingers thick.  The aroma is sweet up front with almost a berry note to it.  As I delve deeper into the aromatics, I get notes of rich, layered, concentrated malt; notes of toffee and a rich meaty malt character.  The meaty maltiness might actually be a product of a touch of oxidation, but if it is, it is a good thing so far.		The taste is only lightly sweet, with a smooth roast character to it.  The beer rests lightly on the palate for the most part, there is a touch of lingering heft to it and the body itself has a medium fullness to it.  Malt is definitely the focus in this beer, there is almost a nutty character to this brew (similar to what is found in some brown ales), and the finish has a light coffee like roast character to it.  This beer has the malt character I would associate with a Dunkel beer.  Despite this, the beer is quite tasty.  		<font size=-4>Purchased: <a href=http://www.58degrees.com/>58 Degrees & Holding Co., Tucson, AZ<font size=-1>",0.0

"THOUGHTS: Kind of like Heineken in a different bottle. Not very good.	TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a clear, light to medium yellow with a small , white head that mostly diminished. The aroma was light grain and moderate grassy hops. The initial flavor was lightly sweet and acidic and slightly sour, while the finish was moderately sweet and acidic and lightly to moderately bitter with a short duration. The flavor was mostly grainy malt and grassy hops. The light body was a little dry with fizzy carbonation and a lightly astringent and slightly metallic finish.",0.0

A beautiful beer in presentation, the bouquet of malt aromas as well as the complex flavors brought about by the grain bill, hops and underlying water chemistry.

The body overall closely matches the flavor and aroma so no expectations are lost although the body could be a little beefier and not hurt this beer.  The DMS and honey (minor) that was picked up on tasting this beer could easily be from storage of this one year old beer.  An excellent example of the style and well worth seeking out.",1.0

"Bottle. Two finger beige thick and light creamy head that mostly lasted. Fair display of lacework. Sparkling body with a light mahogany like color. Aroma of lovely toasted bread, strong underlying caramel feel. Nice cookie like and nutty notes as well. Over the palate some roasted malty bitterness comes to live. Medium bodied with a hint of dry texture and a soft carbonation. Balanced bitter malty roasted flavor with good counter sweet bread like sweetness. Toasted malty lingering finish. Quit nice I thought!",0.0
"A mid golden lager that has enough traces of malt and hops to keep you interested.  Same brewer as the shite Bavaria Premium/Pilsner.  Marginally better than that, but only just.  If it was 40degress outside and this is all I had to drink, Id put up with it.  My sample was in Australia, and came in a narrow 330ml green bottle.",0.0
Bottled 30cl. Courtesy of bierkoning. Appearance: It pours a hazy yellow beer with a small quick diminishing white head. Aroma:  Huge amounts of washing up liquid accompanied by some berries. Artificial. Very interesting and not unpleasant. Flavor and palate: Rather tart. Reminiscent of bubble gum. Artificial. Overly sweet. Overall impression: The aroma is better than the flavor. Not that bad. Underrated in my opinion. Thanks bierkoning!,0.0

[draft] A deep red beer with a beutiful head. The flavor is sweet with notes of black currant and yeast. The aroma has a thin start compared to the aroma but then a bitterness from the malt takes over. The malt-flavor is dominated by roasted and black malt. The aroma containes absolutely no sweetness. It ends on a rather dry malt bitter note on the tongue. Not at all what I expected. I thought it would be sweeter and not so bitter.,0.0

Man havde vel ogs forventet en forskel nr nu der er tale om en alkoholfri udgave af typen.  		Smag: 5/10 	Blomstret og citrusprget smag; overraskende frisk og behagelig. Den sdvanlige ugrede smag fra alkoholfri l, findes kun svagt i baggrunden. llen er derudover dog ikke noget specielt, og eftersmagen er kun meget svagt bitter, og egentlig mest prget af maltsdme.  		Mundflelse: 4/5  	Ganske gennemsnitlig fylde og let cremet, men jeg bliver ndt til at give den 4 i stedet for 3 , ganske simpelt fordi det er en imponerende fylde for en alkoholfri l. Kulsyremngden understreger det friske indtryk fra citrus og lavendel.  		Alt i alt: 11/20",0.0
"Color is a bit off with a clear chestnut brown with a ruby-like glow within, the head more then made up for it though, solid, finger high, thick and firm off-white top that sat a good while before fading down to a thick skim, globby small lacing. Aroma is roasty and sweet of malts with some plum and raisin undertones. Flavors are sweet and lightly dry of a roasted quality that aren't withstanding some length or boldness, not that its really all that necessary for the style but it seems to be over quickly. There's some nice subtlities to the roastyness with toffee, caramel, dark fruits, and grasses that help keep its pleasing tone, the finish is fluffy clean and slightly dry which is nice as well. Slight metalic bittering sneaks in nearer the finish. Feel is lightly creamy with a smooth light carbonation and hold of drying qualities within its medium body. Its a nice little drinker, mild and easy.",1.0
"12 oz bottle.  Nasty.  The aroma is very fruity, thankfully unlike any other beer Ive smelled.  Very thin head and medium pee color (can I say that? but its true!) with a brownish tint, too.  Thin body, probably as its supposed to be.  If Im looking for a light beer, this isnt it.",0.0
"Can @ Corralejo.	Pours pale golden with a big, bubbly, white head. Fair lace-work. Aroma has sweet apple, light metal and sugar. Prickly, watery palate. Flavour is pure water, light sugar and a dose of metal. Boring.",0.0
Packaging sure made this one look deceptively good.  But nothing particularly distinctive.  I was disappointed with something so dark.  Slightly above-average but dont think Ill have again.,0.0

"Juhu, mein erstes Hollndisches Alkoholfreies Wit! Die Schaumkrone hlt nicht gut, farblich ist es typisch Wit, also hell und trb. Es riecht bananig und leicht citronig. Geschmacklich ist es auch bananig, etwas Co und vorallem wssrig. Schmeckt wie ein Bananengetrnk mit maximal 5 Prozent Fruchtgehalt, ein paar s- und geschmacksstoffen und dem rest Wasser. Lsst man es etwas im Mund kommen leichte Lemongras Aromen durch. Ein Nachgeschmack ist berhaupt nicht vorhanden. Fazit: Da trink ich lieber vernnftigen Bananensaft!

"Poured from an Einbecker Schwartzbier bottle, very dark brown with ruby highlights when held to a bright light. A beautiful beer in presentation, the bouquet of malt aromas as well as the complex flavors brought about by the grain bill, hops and underlying water chemistry.  Bitter but not harsh, roasted or toasty but not scorched. The body overall closely matches the flavor and aroma so no expectations are lost although the body could be a little beefier and not hurt this beer.  The DMS and honey (minor) that was picked up on tasting this beer could easily be from storage of this one year old beer.  An excellent example of the style and well worth seeking out.",1.0
"0.25l bottle. Slightly watery, with regular carbonation.  Low sweetness, smoothly grainy, with hints of skunk and mango. Ever so slight aromas of cocoa in a mildly bitter finsh.

"Growler Shenandoah Throwdown, 2010.  Pours a hazed copper with a good off white head.  Aroma is citrus- citra hops?  orange, tangerine sharpness with pine mint and a bit of onion and garlic from off columbus hops? and some dank weed.  Flavor is mint, celery salt, garlicy hops, caramel malts, light sweetness hone them pine mint citrus centennial and citra orange and tangerine with little grapefruit oiliness, bitter in the end with a bit more garlic.  Good but the hops were from a  slightly bad harvest.",0.0

I found this beer on a low budget trip to NYC. We were in spanish harlem and found six packs for 5 bucks. I hate to admit this but I just wanted a cheap beer to go with my dinner. Suprisingly this beer tastes just like Heinieken which I don't mind drinking. Pretty good lager with a crisp taste and a pleasant tart afterglow. Have a couple they really don't fill you up. A good thirsty man's beer.,0.0

"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2006 Full bottle, 6/9/06. Poured straight into a dimpled mug, raising a big stiff ecru foam. Kind of a sugary smell. No skunk here, even though it had been sitting on the loose bottle shelf. Definitely not a schwarzbier in taste, but a nice, easy dunkel. A bit thin on mouthfeel, and the sugar and graininess make a cousin to an American dark beer, but not in a bad way Easy drinking (if that head would ever go down), just a bit of bitter after-taste and milk sugar. Relatively light in alcohol and priced as an everyday beer.	Sampler from bottled labeled ""Schwartzbier,"" Mar 6/06 Ah, no wonder this wasnt quite so black as other Schwartz Ive had. Distinctively brown in color and light in body. The green bottle allowed this import to get a bit skunked. Offers some toffee and caramel notes.",0.0
"Small white head. Clear yellow body with strong big-bubbled carbonation. Light grainy aroma with wet cardboard notes. Dry grainy cardboard taste with chalky notes. Mid-bodied.

"Super Pale, white and yellow.  Very bubbly and a bubbly carbonated white head. Smells a bit of yeast and touch of hops.	Flavor has some hops and a bit of a yeast bite towards the end. Grainy and way too carbonated, adding a sharp taste to it.  Thin, watery, light bodied and very unspectacular.",0.0
"Bright ad cloudy yellow body with bleached white and very firm head. Looks tasty. Coriander, soap, white bread and candy bananas. Starts fairly nice with some fresh character but then fades to a horrible artificial candy-like sweetness. Flavour of a cheap softdrink. I like the idea of an non-alcoholic white but Id rather drink anything else. (33cl bottle, 0,90 EUR?)",0.0

"UPDATED: JAN 30, 2005 You know, this is an older bottle, and it seems to have suffered a bit of a drop off in aroma and flavor. Im not going into a lot of detail. this beer does me right though. Its got nice, rich malty flaves, the caramels, and sweetened malt-o-meal. Nice toffee aroma, with maple. I love the blackened grains, stark and bitter and smoky. Like an old curmudgeon in a comfy, malty recliner tossing hop flowers in the fireplace. I cant wait to try some more schwarzbiers. I bet this is dynamite when its fresher.	Addendum: Smells a bit like old tree bark, and leather. Clearly sepia; beautiful transluscence with a healthy froth. The lace slips down easily like garters on prom night. Delicious malty darjeeling. Unsweetened baking chocolate, walnuts, dark brown sugar. Give me a pitcher with rye bread, radish, and a nutty, strong cheese.",1.0

"Grassy aroma. Frotth head that diminishes slowly. Hoppy, hay-like flavor that lingers on. Perfectly acceptable German pilsener.",0.0
"Color is a bit off with a clear chestnut brown with a ruby-like glow within, the head more then made up for it though, solid, finger high, thick and firm off-white top that sat a good while before fading down to a thick skim, globby small lacing. Aroma is roasty and sweet of malts with some plum and raisin undertones. Flavors are sweet and lightly dry of a roasted quality that aren't withstanding some length or boldness, not that its really all that necessary for the style but it seems to be over quickly. There's some nice subtlities to the roastyness with toffee, caramel, dark fruits, and grasses that help keep its pleasing tone, the finish is fluffy clean and slightly dry which is nice as well. Slight metalic bittering sneaks in nearer the finish. Feel is lightly creamy with a smooth light carbonation and hold of drying qualities within its medium body. Its a nice little drinker, mild and easy.",1.0

I would be much more inclined to call this an American Dark Lager but I digress. Coffe and copper. Fizzy.  Undeinable corny dry flatness.  Reminds me of St. Paulis Dark only much more flavorful. Cherries and much more of a refined sweetness. However it is still carny. Nose is underwhelming.  Flavors are as well. Corniness immediately. Flat dry palate with lots of leftover chemically adjunctness. Sweet but not artfully.  Very unremarkable. Comes and goes. Flavors remind me of coke.

"UPDATED: JAN 13, 2005 An initially clean, refreshing and very cheap drink. Light hop and even lighter malt aroma - like dry cracker biscuits. Everything about this is light and laid back - the sweetness is light, the bitterness is light. Its a quick refreshing drink that doesnt stand up to scrutiny.

"11.2oz green bottle from The Lighthouse in Manchester.  Pours a dark copper brown with ruby-red highlights and a thin light tan head.  Smells strongly of caramel with coffee and chocolate playing strong supporting roles.  Tastes very roasty with chocolate and coffee at the fore.  Caramel and hints of continental hops are also present.  Flavors are a bit more subtle than expected but mesh rather well.  On the lighter side of medium-bodied with moderate carbonation.  Not the most robust Schwarzbier Ive tried, but theres nothing wrong with this one.  Its tasty and very drinkable.  A solid Schwarzbier.",1.0

Well, this smells like your typical Dutch pale macro lager, that funky grassiness with a little grain husk, a lightly backing sweet pale malts.		The right amount of steady carbonation and a crisp, smooth light bodied mouthfeel.		Bland euro lager tasting, grain husks and sweet, sugary pale malts, the hops are softly bitter and a bit neutral tasting, some light veggie flavor and a dryish sweet grainy finish, passable macro drinkability.

"Pours with a very dark, almost brown, but really mostly a concentrated amber color.  It is not really black, but it is dark enough, and close enough to black that it is opaque unless it is held up to the light.  When held up to the light the beer shows a brilliantly clear dark ruby color.  The head is a lightly brown, tan color and is initially two fingers thick.  The aroma is sweet up front with almost a berry note to it.  As I delve deeper into the aromatics, I get notes of rich, layered, concentrated malt; notes of toffee and a rich meaty malt character.  The meaty maltiness might actually be a product of a touch of oxidation, but if it is, it is a good thing so far.		The taste is only lightly sweet, with a smooth roast character to it.  The beer rests lightly on the palate for the most part, there is a touch of lingering heft to it and the body itself has a medium fullness to it.  Malt is definitely the focus in this beer, there is almost a nutty character to this brew (similar to what is found in some brown ales), and the finish has a light coffee like roast character to it.  This beer has the malt character I would associate with a Dunkel beer.  Despite this, the beer is quite tasty.  		<font size=-4>Purchased: <a href=http://www.58degrees.com/>58 Degrees & Holding Co., Tucson, AZ<font size=-1>",0.0

Typical northern Euro lager - but not bad. Will be my lawnmower beer for the next few weeks as I bought a whole 12 - glad its palatable!",0.0
Got it in a 5% ABV 250ml bottle in Sweden. Taste is very bitter for a lager. Not to my taste probably. Not a beer i would recommend though.,0.0
Light yellow; nearly no head.  Skunked as heck in both aroma and flavor.  Some grains in there somewhere but hard to detect.  Watery.  Lousy beer.,0.0
"Cheap and ordinary, kinda refreshing.",0.0
"Sparkling cloudy pale with loads of small bubbles and a frothy white head. Bready cereal malt aroma with a touch of banana and some earthy notes. Extremely sweet in the mouth, much like a soda water, with some citrusy notes and next to no bitterness. Very light body - no surprise - with a thin texture, fizzy carbonaton and a sweet short but slightly astringent and sulfur-like finish. Quite refreshing when cold, but undrinkable when the beers  temperature rises above 7 degrees celcius.",0.0

"Bottled. Dark red/brown colour.  Almost no head and no lace at all. Nutty, roastmalty aroma with a hint of liquorice and coffee. Flat, roastmalty taste ending in a nut-bitter finish. Lightbodied and slightly bland. Not enough carbonation, too, therefore underscoring the watery and lightbodied palate-impressions.",0.0
"Pours a four finger white head that fades quickly leaving a good lace.  Crystal clear amber color.  Medium-strong carbonation and light bodied.  Slight hoppy nose, traces of skunkiness.  Starts with a slight sweetness, late hoppy/bitter finish.  Another green bottle that doesnt cut it.  $1.50 for a 12oz bottle from Capital Convenience Concord, NH.",0.0
"500ml can on vacation in Malta, can says 5.0% abv. Golden pour with minimal white head. Sweet malt aroma, with a faint hop finish. Crisp semi sweet flavor, not much hop flavor. Nice refreshing beer here in the hot mediteranean.",0.0
"UPDATED: AUG 1, 2006 The aroma has coffee, chocolate, raisins, and caramel. The appearance is dark with a medium foamy head. The flavor has dark fruit, cardboard, chocolate, burnt malt, and bitter hops. The palate is average just like this beer.",0.0

"Deep red-brown body, thick light tan head.  Earthy, toasty aroma with a skunky twang.  Flavor is light, toasty and surprisingly tangy with hints of bakers chocolate and yeast.  There isnt too much to like about this beer, and I suspect it is somewhat light-damaged.",0.0
"Flaske 0,33l fra Systembolaget i Kiruna. Fortrt i heimen 21 Sep 11 sammen med Rune. Gylden p farge. Litt uklar. OK skumdannelse som blir helt borte. God sitrusaroma med innslag av banan. Banan ogs i smaken. God! Blir vel st etterhvert. Et godt alkoholfritt l.",0.0
"One thing positive about the beer, was that it looked very well, at least for a pilsener. Skunky hop smell. Hoppy pilsener taste. Bitter dry finish, weak though. Cheap pilsener.",0.0

"Einbecker ""Schwarzbier"" is a ruby brown lager with a sandy slight head.  The aroma is grainy-- roasted barly.  Its fresh and faint.  Its thin in the mouth.  The flavor is of deep malt.  Its lightly bitter and a little funky.  My drinking party and I all agreed that this was a Dunkel, not a Schwarzbier.  Why did they call this a Schwarzbier?",0.0
